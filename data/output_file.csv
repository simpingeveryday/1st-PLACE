i have been feeling more and more down for over a month i have started having trouble sleeping due to panic attacks but they are almost never triggered by something that i know of,answers about our inner lives are most successfully reached from a sense of feeling grounded in oneselffirst step is to accept your nervousness and restless sleep  as often as possible sleep during daytimes in order for your body to catch up on its need for restaccept too about feeling down  it is normal to feel down once in a while  from this place of selfacceptance trust any answers which come up to your mind  often answers about complicated topics come in small pieces not all at once as a whole unitalso your description about panic attacks is also completely normal  they often arise unrelated to particular conditions at a given moment  they are a healthy symptom your body is trying to expel bad feelings and does this by having the anxiety erupt at timesso selfacceptance tolerance of being on a process of clearing out worn out emotional clutter and sleep at odd times if possible are all ways to stabilize yourself which will also feel calm and good
i have been feeling more and more down for over a month i have started having trouble sleeping due to panic attacks but they are almost never triggered by something that i know of,it could be really helpful to see a counselortherapist about your increasing depressionpanic symptoms finding out the cause of depressionanxiety isnt always as straightforward as it seems since both issues tend to become patterns we engage in rather than solely related to a specific triggerreason for example if i am feeling down about a particular circumstance in my life then i start seeing life through this lens of feeling down and typically ill start to see a lot more that i get down about and it can really build very quickly on itself same with anxiety obviously this is a very simplified example and it can be very difficult to see how the pattern is maintained but thats where working with a counselortherapist comes in i would be curious about whether you can start to notice the initial sensations of panic and if you can through the panic attack continue to maintain awareness of the actual physical sensations even better if you can talk yourself through the sensations youre feeling  such as saying to yourself okay im breathing really rapidly and my heart is racing now my palms are sweaty and my chest is feeling really tight reminding yourself that its just your bodys reaction to stress and while it might be overreacting right now youre okay and eventually it will go away i highly recommend the sam for anxiety management app for the anxiety piece and i wouldnt be surprised if addressing the anxiety helped to address some of the depression too

a few years ago i was making love to my wife when for no known reason i lost my erection now im in my early 30s and my problem has become more and more frequent this is causing major problems for my ego and its diminishing my self esteem this has resulted in ongoing depression and tearing apart my marriage i am devastated and cannot find a cause for these issues i am very attracted to my wife and want to express it in the bedroom like i used to what could be causing this and what can i do about it,first step always is to do a medical rule out so that youre sure the problem is psychological and emotion based not a medical condition which requires care and attentionif you are medically clear in the reasons for losing your erection then reflect on what may be creating a loss in confidence in either who you are and what youre doing with your life or whether your wife has these sort of problems within herselfoften a problem transfers ownership of who shows itif you are a sensitive person its possible your erection problem reflects your wifes insecurities and selfdoubt  if she is someone who is reluctant to talk about feeling unsure then in a certain way by you showing a problem she can avoid looking at herselfthere may not be a direct cause such as usually exists in a medical problemmedicine looks for symptoms to treatour emotional lives are much more indirectif you feel stress at work or are unhappy in the place you live for example then your frustration may show up in your sex lifebasically do a broad inward search of your life and what it holds and maybe ask your wife to do the sameyou may clear the air within yourselves and between each other so the problem goes away

i selfharm and i stop for awhile then when i see something sad or depressing i automatically want to selfharm,in a way selfharm can present somewhat like an addiction  according to new research within the field of neuroscience there is a valid explanation for this  when a person cuts or uses other forms of self harm the body produces endorphins to help make a person feel better  if a person was dealing with depression or high anxiety that might be misinterpreted by the brain as a way to help oneself feel better and a new neural network or map might form addiction that would utilize this new behavior  another way to look at it would be thru a behavioral lens a positive reward for a behavior even though the behavior has other long term negative consequences  consider working with someone who can both have you work on and address those items that trigger your behavior and the root causes in this case sadness or depression and second find someone who can help give you alternatives that take into account the neurological requirement by replacing the behavior with another behavior such as snapping a rubber band on the wrist and working to extinguish the unwanted behavior  someone who is trained in dialectic behavior therapy andor interpersonal neurobiology would most likely have the skills and means available to address this with you
i selfharm and i stop for awhile then when i see something sad or depressing i automatically want to selfharm,selfharm has a way of becoming a goto method of coping when we get stuck using selfharm as a way to deal and manage emotions when something serious happens it totally makes sense that that will be one the first things to go through the mind it is its own kind of addiction there is a therapy dbt or dialectical behavior therapy which focusing on giving you new tools to get through hard times understand and manage your emotions to stay present and to deal with relationships this one of the most effective interventions there is for selfharm if you are interested in dbt reach a local therapist in your area and ask if they do dbt or can recommend you to a dbt program this can help immensely selfharm recovery is totally possible but it is definitely hard work
i have been diagnosed with general anxiety and depression by my family doctor they wrote a prescription for me to have an emotional support dog i have the paper work and i gave it to my apartment manager they said i cant keep the esd because im not disabled what do you suggest i do,this can be a difficult situation  typically only animals that are specifically trains to accomplish a specific task are legally protected as service animsls even though that can be very helpful emotional support animals are not generally protected in the same wayyou might not be able to make your landlord accommodate you if possible you may want to consider a different apparent that is more animal friendly
i have been diagnosed with general anxiety and depression by my family doctor they wrote a prescription for me to have an emotional support dog i have the paper work and i gave it to my apartment manager they said i cant keep the esd because im not disabled what do you suggest i do,at present the american disability association ada only allows protection and guiltiness for service animals which is fall under a separate distinction from emotional support animals emotional support animals are untrained animals typically pets or other domestic animals that provide wonderful services to their owners and there are many benefits to having oneservice animals who are trained to provide specific services for an individual with limitations that make them fall under what the ada defines as disabled are protected under specific laws and must be accommodated in public places where the human they serve is present while it may be beneficial to request that the therapist who prescribed the dog to you write a letter to the apartment manager it sounds like the manager is aware of ada guidelines and the simplest course of action may be to find an alternative residence if that is a plausible option
i have been diagnosed with general anxiety and depression by my family doctor they wrote a prescription for me to have an emotional support dog i have the paper work and i gave it to my apartment manager they said i cant keep the esd because im not disabled what do you suggest i do,agree with the apartment managers viewpoint that your disability is not a physical limitationask the manager if theyd accept an explanatory letter from a therapist who is licensed to diagnosis emotional disabilitiesif the answer is yes then find a therapist whos willing to cooperate with what you need from them and find out this particular therapists terms of working with you to compose such a letterif the manager tells you no then find out who is above this person or entity and find out how to formally introduce your request to the board or apartment owner or whoever actually is the legal owner of the building
i have been diagnosed with general anxiety and depression by my family doctor they wrote a prescription for me to have an emotional support dog i have the paper work and i gave it to my apartment manager they said i cant keep the esd because im not disabled what do you suggest i do,this is tricky because there are different types of emotional support dogs the ones that are officially trained actually go through months of training and then are paired with someone for whom they perform specific tasksyou may benefit from looking at the blog written by valerie parrott who has an emotional support dog due to severe anxiety and panic i will warn you that her blog is very blunt but she is honest and she has gone through this process httpsthedogintheroomwordpresscom20160620whatmakesaservicedogmore508
i tried telling my husband i was depressed and he ignored me he said youre always sad or depressed and he picked up his phone and ignored me i said please dont exaggerate that isnt true and he said whatever babe you just want to be sad how can i get through to him so he will take me seriously,ouch its really hard to deal with a spouse that isnt taking you seriously in this case i would plan for and schedule a time to talk with him about this i would tell him that you need about 30 minutes to talk to him with minimal interruptions about something that is important to you schedule a time write notes if you need reminders about what you need to express and tell him how you feel ideally you would focus more on istatements instead of telling him what he is doing wrong for example i feel ignored vs you always ignore me by focusing on how you feel he is less likely to feel attacked and get defensive some people go to couples or marriage counseling for help with communication chances are there are things that both of you do that hurts your communication overall try to talk to him directly and try not to get defensive if he continues to say youre always sad  then stay calm say okay can you help me understand that more or thats interesting tell me what you see  reach out to a couples counselor for more help with communication strategies sometimes a 3rd party can help you both see things in a different perspective hope this helps
i tried telling my husband i was depressed and he ignored me he said youre always sad or depressed and he picked up his phone and ignored me i said please dont exaggerate that isnt true and he said whatever babe you just want to be sad how can i get through to him so he will take me seriously,this is so hard it is hard for someone to understand what depression is without having experienced it themselves unfortunately people without depression sometimes mistake it as feeling sorry for ourselves or just moping around which is not what depression is at all sometimes i think that it is easier for family members to see it as a choice than to admit that someone they love is hurting and they dont know what to do if he is willing i wonder if there may be a depression support group in your area such as nami or dbsa where he could hear from from others living with depression and their families if not i wonder if you all might watch a documentary together such as no kidding me too or call me crazy if not that ive sometimes encouraged folk to just leave some information on depression and how family can help like a pamphlet or handout on a table or around the house we tend to get curious and read things we find on the table wishing you the best
i tried telling my husband i was depressed and he ignored me he said youre always sad or depressed and he picked up his phone and ignored me i said please dont exaggerate that isnt true and he said whatever babe you just want to be sad how can i get through to him so he will take me seriously,it can be hard for husbands to hear that their wife is unhappy by nature men tend to be more of the fix it type so if they are sad they fix it if their wife is sad they fix it he may feel helpless to help you and that may be why he is saying those things to you its not that he doesnt care or that he doesnt take them seriously he might just have no idea how to help i would start by making an appointment to talk with a therapist about your sadness meeting with a therapist may help you to learn some tools and strategies that can help you to manage some of the sadness you are feeling a therapist can also help you to gain some understanding and insight into why you might be experiencing sadness depression is not something you have to sit with therapy can help once your husband sees that you are being proactive in addressing your sadnessdepression he will probably be more open to listening to you and supporting you he might start to have ideas and input on how you two can work together to change some of the situations or things that might be holding you bakc
i tried telling my husband i was depressed and he ignored me he said youre always sad or depressed and he picked up his phone and ignored me i said please dont exaggerate that isnt true and he said whatever babe you just want to be sad how can i get through to him so he will take me seriously,oh dearfrom what you write your husband doesnt have any interest to know about you and your sad feelingsstay clear in understanding that you already did your part by asking him to listen and care about the way you feelin this example he told you he doesnt careits up to him to open his mind and heart to youdepending on how motivated to continue asking him to hear you try until you feel satisfied that youve given him enough chances to know who you are  at a certain number of tries at this youll either have success or notjust dont try forever because doing so will increase your depressed feelings
its not entirely true to say i enjoy being sad but i always find a way to feel that way i listen to sad music read tragic stories and in a twisted way like how bad it makes me feel i focus on negative aspects of my life even if they arent legitimate or i just make it seem negative,it sounds like you are noticing that you are drawn towards sad and negative content and its hard to understand why this may sound counterintuitive but sometimes we do things that on the surface may look problematic or even cause us some real problems because it serves us in some unseen way a simple example would be somebody who is addicted to a substance their addiction may be causing serious problems in their life and they may even know it but the addiction serves them by helping them to avoid painful feelings that they anticipate having if they quit using now i am not saying that what you describe is an addiction it is just a really illustrative example of the unseen benefitone thing i would be wondering about is what is the unseen benefit of seeking out sad and negative content id also be wondering what your relationship is to other feelings these are things you may benefit from exploring with a competent therapist
its not entirely true to say i enjoy being sad but i always find a way to feel that way i listen to sad music read tragic stories and in a twisted way like how bad it makes me feel i focus on negative aspects of my life even if they arent legitimate or i just make it seem negative,i applaud your courage in asking this question to gain some deeper insight into what is happening in your life this is one of the most common things that i personally have seen in the population of individuals who suffer from depression it is often that i notice clients focusing on the negative to the complete dismissal of the positive when they are dealing with depression it is inspiring that you have noticed this in yourself because many clients are not aware that this is a pattern for them or are not yet willing to face that depression has become a pattern they cling to depression if dealt with for extended periods of time can become a way of life an identity of sorts that is very difficult to part from while you desperately desire happiness who would you be without the depression sometimes it is scarier to journey into the unknown in this case happiness than it is to stay in the known and the often times comfortable space of your depression human beings for the most part fear and stray away from change in general especially a change that is so impactful allowing yourself to confront the possibility of change as positive with the support of a professional counselor is often extremely helpful

i have been dealing with depression and anxiety for a number of years i have been on medication but lately my depression has felt worse can counseling help,certainly counselling can help however there is a caveat namely you will need the right counsellor with the right approach this leads to two questions 1 what are the identifiers for the right counsellor and 2 what is the right approach1 what are the identifiers for the right counsellor the right counsellor will almost certainly have a lot of experience he or she will have done a lot personal work and have an ongoing practice of inner work both on their own and with the support of an experienced therapist this person will be viewing you as a human being with challenges not as a diagnostic category he or she will be willing to work with you over an extended period of time and have experience doing such work further they will be well versed in approaches that are responsive to you in the moment and overall the indepth work will be collaborativel designed in an ongoing way that is responsive to you the moment your overall life experience and their inthemoment experience it goes without saying that you will subjectively evaluate the felt sense of connection with this person and the feeling that they are invested in their work with you value you as a human being and value the connection as well it is crucial that you feel this connection and that your therapist gets you 2 what is the right approach as carl jung stated when the doctor sits down with the patient he or she must drop all theories and learn the theory of this person the approach must include a bond between you and your therapist that is in a continuous process of development attention to preverbal imprinting development of awareness ability ongoing development of the ability to attend to and stay with inner experience development of a process orientation attention to egoic structures that were seeded from the earliest days in the service of perceptions of threats to needs being met identification of current egoic states and work with these inner selves and their relationship with each other to facilitate movement from developmental points of arrest increased ability to access and contain nonordinary states of consciousness attending to what is and working with this in the service of moving towards optimal human developmentdepression is generally experienced as the system shutting down anxiety is a signal that something is wrong anxiety is not the problem it is a sign that there is a problem the core of these issues is a lack of inner security that is the outcome of insufficient bonding the work of psychotherapy is to establish an environment and relationship that will facilitate work with the bonding ruptures and reinitiation of the developmental process that stopped at an early stage
i have been dealing with depression and anxiety for a number of years i have been on medication but lately my depression has felt worse can counseling help,my initial response  consider a more comprehensive mh assessment to determine other factors a medical evaluation is warranted to rule out poor health issues blood work is helpful review what hadnt helped

there are many people willing to lovingly provide me with a home i have food clothes and a university education but i never feel like i belong even when i have a good time with people who are supposed to be close i feel like im just out with friends and i never go home,from the little bit you wrote my guess is you havent figured out where and how to lay down your own set of rootsusually people who have a university level eduction are old enough to work in order to support themselvesunless you have a medical condition which limits or prevents you from working a fulltime job would you guess that the effort and thought involved in deciding in what professional area and geographic location to look for work would offer you a way to establish your identitymy suggestion is to pay more attention to your own likes dislikes and interests  to know these areas more deeply would define the type of people with whom you identify have a common interest and with whom youd like to socializethe more you realize who you are the easier time youll have to find likeminded others and feel securely at home with them and yourselfagain if you have a medical disability or condition which prevents employment or easily socializing with other people then this advice would need to be modified for your specific strengths
there are many people willing to lovingly provide me with a home i have food clothes and a university education but i never feel like i belong even when i have a good time with people who are supposed to be close i feel like im just out with friends and i never go home,for some people having a sense of belonging takes some timeyou mentioned that you have an education and some basic daily needs i wonder if you may be able to look at your relationship with yourself and what makes you feel happy safe and having a sense of accomplishment if you have those feelings i wonder how you define trust and who you trustyou say you have a good time with people who are supposed to be close so i wonder what keeps them from feeling close i have also wondering if you have been emotionally hurt in the past and if so you may have some protective defenses that you use maybe on purpose maybe not to protect yourself from being hurt again remember that this idea comes in degrees where you can be more perfect in certain situations and a little less in others being emotionally protected is on a spectrum or continuum where you can make an infinite amount of adjustments or changes with different people and situationsi also wonder what it is that you want in your home and how you define it consider giving yourself permission to think about how you would define your perfect home in a world where there were no realistic restrictions such as money or location after you have that consider what parts of that you can have perhaps there is a small part that you could make a reality within a week or sothank you for reaching out if this continues to be difficult for you consider seeing a local mental health professional so you can discuss some more specific details
i am really worried about one of my friends because i think he has major depression he disagrees with me on that he is shut off when it comes to talking to people and telling them how he really feels he told me he feels empty inside and the only emotions he feels are anger and sadness i suggested to him to get help and talk to his mom about it but he refuses,first of all i can tell that you really care about your friend and i think its great that you are reaching out with your concern its hard to determine whether your friend would meet the criteria for an official diagnosis of depression without working with him however whether he does or not therapy may be beneficial for him in working through these difficult feelings and relational challenges unfortunately you cant make your friend get help he will ultimately need to make that decision for himself however you can talk to him about your concerns and your hopes that he will reach out for help
ive become so jaded that i cant control my thoughts i cannot focus on anything and been having anxiety attacks,maybe your thoughts require your attention and the best course would be to pay attention and follow themif youre in an especially stressful or uncertain time in your life then the best way through is to understand the tension you feelit keeps trying to get you to know whats going on deep within youanxiety is a sign of stress and weariness  your thoughts are a chance to simply rest and know what they would like you to knowthen when that process is finished your anxiety will no longer be necessary and will most likely leave you alone
ive become so jaded that i cant control my thoughts i cannot focus on anything and been having anxiety attacks,i imagine that its pretty disconcerting to feel as though you lost yourselfwhen you said that you are jaded im not sure whether you mean that you are jaded toward someone something life in general or some combination thereofone of the difficult things about anxiety is that anxiety can lead to more anxiety because of being concerned about having another panic attack consider remembering that panic attacks usually only last a few minutes and the reason they dont go away right away is because of the way your brain releases chemicals because some part of your brain is reacting as if you are in danger in some wayas far as finding yourself you may consider looking at what parts of each day you can control as a way to stay centered you could also focus on something that makes you feel happy andor comfortableyou may also consider the list of values here to give yourself an idea of what is most important to you what it is that you are living by now and what values you would prefer to live by httpwwwtherapistaidcomtherapyworksheetvaluesclarificationif this proves to be difficult consider seeing a local therapist

i feel lazy and numb i have no interest in things,maybe right now it is time for you to rest before the next wave of new activity comes alongto have no interest may mean you are already so saturated with recent situations and their meaning that you are naturally withdrawing in order to regain your energy
im currently struggling with diagnosed depression anxiety and misophonia also i am 99 sure i have borderline personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder i read the dsmiv taken college psychology etc i know it in my heart i have them is selfdiagnosing okay with the right research,any diagnosis is limited in its usefulnessknowing the name of some typical ways you may feel think and behave doesnt help you or anyone to understand why the person is the way they are and how to change any of these characteristicsboth selfdiagnosing and being diagnosed are equally unhelpful to know why you are the way you are and what to do about itconsider yourself a person who wants to find a better way to be who you are and this will get you further with better results than to read a list of descriptions which all are very indicting and negative sounding
im currently struggling with diagnosed depression anxiety and misophonia also i am 99 sure i have borderline personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder i read the dsmiv taken college psychology etc i know it in my heart i have them is selfdiagnosing okay with the right research,hello and thank you for your question selfdiagnosing is something that we all do about one health issue or another taking a guess about what may or may not be happening to us is completely normal however the actual clinical diagnoses of a mental health disorder requires a licensed mental health professional here are a few reasons for this 1 making a clinical diagnosis often requires other things besides matching up the symptoms of a disorder to come to a diagnoses for any of the things you mentioned a counselor would consult the dsm but they may also use some type of screening tool assessment or scale many disorders have similarities and it requires someone with training to tease out the differences in the symptoms 2 our judgement is sometimes off when it comes to assessing ourselves we really cant be objective something as serious as determining a diagnosis really needs to be done by someone who has that objectivity in addition once you know your diagnosis treating it usually requires help from a professional 3 sometimes the symptoms of a mental health disorder makes selfdiagnoses impossible in and of itself for example someone could be having hallucinations or delusions and not realize it that would clearly make it impossible for them to diagnose themselves there a many examples where something like this could happen with different mental health disorders there are other reasons but these are three important ones now does this mean that you are wrong about your diagnosis maybe not you may be correct but it is important to get this confirmed by a professional mental health clinician if a disorder is then found you can begin to talk about treatment hope this was helpful be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpcc ncc
in the past year two of my best and only close friends moved to different states now i have nobody to hang out with im always alone and i honestly havent hung out with anyone since they left im super lonely what should i do to make new friends because they moved and i have no friends now i think im falling into a depression or something i just need help,definitely it is sad to lose friends who are a regular part of daily lifehow did you meet the two friends who just moved away  its possible that you could look for similar situations and see if anyone catches your interest to know as a friendkeeping in mind that friendship is based on trust and common interests and that these qualities require time to observe and develop think of what you can do to keep happy while these paths unfoldin addition to being open to meeting new friends involve yourself in projects from which youll feel satisfied by your own results
i am the problem i make my family argue because of me my mom has even said it its constantly like this i cause problems i am worthless i cant stop crying sometimes i have to cry myself to sleep i cant even leave my room because my family cant stand me,i am so very sorry for how pressured and sad you feel right nowdefinitely all family members have an effect on the other onesfrom what you write your family members are not considering the effect their negative comments have on youalso keep in mind that each person is responsible for deciding to argue or find a different way to discuss a problem you are not in control of the other people in your familymore likely they take the easy way out and blame you for what they dont want to know about themselvesstay aware that the familys decision to target you doesnt mean that you are doing something wrong  certainly your existence is not wrong which is the degree to which the unfairness seems to have spreadwhat to do about it is read about family systems to see more explanations on how you are being unfairly treatedalso stay in touch with friends bc these are the people who value and respect you
im depressed often and my mind goes a million miles a minute every once in a while things are okay for a few days after a bit i start noticing that i am picking at my skin profusely after roughly a week the anxiety is back and still picking sometimes i find myself causing fights to have change,one way to know yourself a little better and why the dynamics you describe take place is to understand the particular dynamics of your life contextlook at your major areas of where you spend your time whether you are happy with the people with whom you socialize how you feel toward family members and how they seem to feel toward youif you examine your relationships and life this way then you may start to notice areas where you have some control or at least a say in how your life is goingif you are socializing among people whom you dont like have a job you dont like and your family mistreats you and you mistreats them for example then anxiety and depression are an understandable natural resultif you make improvements in your life and relationships even tiny improvements and even the effort and intention to improve you may find your anxiety and depression dissipatingpeople usually feel their worst when they feel lack of control in their lifelook for ways you can regain andor strengthen yours
im depressed often and my mind goes a million miles a minute every once in a while things are okay for a few days after a bit i start noticing that i am picking at my skin profusely after roughly a week the anxiety is back and still picking sometimes i find myself causing fights to have change,hello and thank you for your question i am very sorry that you are struggling i have a few thoughts and perhaps some of my colleagues will add something else depression and anxiety can both be chronic conditions as you have experienced this means that they may always require treatment in order to have some kind of relief from them treatment could mean medication or some kind of counseling some people may take medication for the rest of their lives some people may go to counseling at times when the depression and anxiety worsens as you mentioned sometimes the symptoms improve for a little while but they can also come back when they do it is important to talk to your medical provider if you are getting medication andor to go back to your counselor and talk to them about the symptoms that have returned skin picking and some other behaviors are not uncommon for people who are experiencing something like anxiety many people report that they do this when they feel anxious and some say it calms them down it is not really a surprise that you are constantly trying to change things and even starting fights to do so these are ways to try to avoid escape and distract yourself from the feelings of anxiety and depression that is a very normal thing to do nobody likes these feelings and so distraction is something we naturally try in order to get rid of them the problem is that things like distraction and escape do not work as a longterm solution in fact they usually make things worse for many different reasons depression and anxiety can be treated but it is likely something you will need some help with i would recommend finding a counselor who has experience with anxiety and depression medication can be helpful but i still recommend counseling the reason for this is that the medication can help with symptoms while the counseling can address the symptoms and provide you with very helpful skills be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpcc ncc
im very depressed how do i find someone to talk to,you have already taken the brave first step of making the decision to heal from it and find a professional that will help you do so there are lots of different options nowadays for therapists as you can see them online or in an office my biggest tip for you is to use psychology today or counsel chat to find a therapist enter in your zip code and you will find many different therapists you can talk to  be sure to find someone that you most resonate with and ask them any questions you may have many times therapists will provide free consultations and this can be a great opportunity to see if you are a good fit
im very depressed how do i find someone to talk to,the first step which youve taken is actually wanting to talk to someone its a great sign that you are seeking to reach out for help and there are therapists everywhere there are even therapists online so you dont have to be that close to them or their officethere are several sites that i refer people to to begin the process of looking for a therapist i usually have them start with psychologytodaycom once there there is a therapist directory you can narrow choices down by ages that they work with insurance they accept depression as an issue they focus in etc you can also narrow down by therapists modality but that can get complicated if you arent too familiar with the various theoretical approaches its important that you find someone that you feel understands your situation that might mean that they identify an issue you are having in their profile or on their professional website but you should try to meet a couple of different therapists if you arent quite sure it can be challenging that first session but your best note not the best therapist will help you feel comfortable or as comfortable as possible given therapy can be uncomfortable especially at first and understood from the getgoi have found that asking friends or family for names and recommendations is also a common way to find a therapist because it can come from a trusted referral source but remember that we are all different so what works for one might not always be a good fit and again it could take a couple of first sessions with different therapists to know if someone is a good fit sometimes it can take a few sessions and if there is no one around that can give a name or two then searching online is quite common and can yield positive resultsand try not to give up finding a therapist is not easy but finding a good one for you is extremely rewarding

im in my late teens and live with my dad the only time i go out is for my college classes sometimes when i see my friends i want to talk with them but sometimes i wont want to talk to them for days or even weeks sometimes i feel im not worth knowing or im never going to do anything right are they right am i depressed,i wouldnt necessarily say you are clinically depressed based on that first paragraph in your question because that could describe more introverted behavior people who feel more energy from a more internal approach as opposed to those who feel more energy from being among others it is more in the second paragraph that i would be inclined to say that further exploration is definitely needed the diagnosis of major depressive disorder is more than just those two symptoms but there are more mild forms of depression that can be equally damaging to someone if left untreatedhowever one of the trickiest parts of this is that someone who feels they are not worth knowing may also believe they are not worth having a therapist know them and even less worthy of being helped do you feel that might be you if so could we acknowledge that as a part of the big picture and all wrapped up in these feelings about yourself and realizing that thoughts and feelings arent always rational in that you are worth getting the helpmy recommendation just from the information would be that you seek out a supportive listening ear in the form of a therapist who can allow you the space to express some of these difficult experiences and help you name for yourself what your struggle is to empower you to name it for yourself as opposed to everyone labeling andor judging you for it might be an extremely worthwhile start for you
im in my late teens and live with my dad the only time i go out is for my college classes sometimes when i see my friends i want to talk with them but sometimes i wont want to talk to them for days or even weeks sometimes i feel im not worth knowing or im never going to do anything right are they right am i depressed,hi depression can look different for everybody it sounds to me like what your family is trying to tell you that they are worried about you and think this behavior might be a result of depression if what you are experiencing seems fine and normal to you it may be nothing to worry about it is very common to have thoughts of doubt about yourself and your abilities and it may help to open up about those thoughts to people you trust developing relationships with friends and families can be a very rewarding experience but it can take a brave person to reach out
im in my late teens and live with my dad the only time i go out is for my college classes sometimes when i see my friends i want to talk with them but sometimes i wont want to talk to them for days or even weeks sometimes i feel im not worth knowing or im never going to do anything right are they right am i depressed,if we were in my office together i would offer that most likely you are feeling somewhat depressed its most important for me to impress that you dont have to live like this other helpful information have you experienced similar symptoms before anyone in your family been depressed before based on other physiological signs like quality of sleep appetite energymotivation i would present you with some treatment options one of which would be to consult with a medication management provider to assess your symptoms and provide additional information for you to consider
im in my late teens and live with my dad the only time i go out is for my college classes sometimes when i see my friends i want to talk with them but sometimes i wont want to talk to them for days or even weeks sometimes i feel im not worth knowing or im never going to do anything right are they right am i depressed,i would not focus on what other people say do you feel what you have described impacts your day to day functioning try to evaluate how is your self esteem motivation and self confidence how about negative thoughts or hopelessness any concerns about your grades sliding down if you answered yes to any questions may be its time to see a counsellor
im in my late teens and live with my dad the only time i go out is for my college classes sometimes when i see my friends i want to talk with them but sometimes i wont want to talk to them for days or even weeks sometimes i feel im not worth knowing or im never going to do anything right are they right am i depressed,although some people managing depression feel sad or down  it is a possible to have depression without an obvious sad mood  many people indicate that they feel numb or flat  people managing depression often have low motivation they may stay in bed for long periods of time and only get up for absolutely necessary activities  people with depression may also feel inappropriate guilt or shame  if you have been experiencing the symptoms you described for more than two weeks i recommend that you see a counselor to get a more indepth evaluation  the symptoms you are experiencing are typical of depression and with a bit of support you could regain energy and improved selfesteem  the stigma surrounding mental health can make a diagnosis or a label of depression seem scary  the important thing to remember is that mental health disorders are as important as and as treatable physical health disorders   hang in there  healing is possible
im in my late teens and live with my dad the only time i go out is for my college classes sometimes when i see my friends i want to talk with them but sometimes i wont want to talk to them for days or even weeks sometimes i feel im not worth knowing or im never going to do anything right are they right am i depressed,hello being a teenager in our society today can cause depression quite easily we look at the world in which we live and the doubts we have about being able to make a contribution or to have value and worth with the people around us and we begin to internalize those messages of selfworth if that alone were not enough you are trying to figure out where you want to go in life and who you are supposed to be in the world teens are faced with pressures of being judged by your peers for how you present yourself following current fashions possessing the trendy things and hanging out with the in crowd heres a secret that might help with most of those issues not much of those problems ive just described will really matter as they might seem to right now in the real world if you are feeling depression because you feel you lack some of those things that are seen as important by others like your peers i can assure you that being someone who is kind compassionate understanding of another persons suffering and the effort you make to be the best person you can become in the world will far outweigh anything you experienced in your teen yearswhen we are young we judge everything based on what our peers have what they say the way they dress whos popular whos not popular and for the most of it all of that is external so the question becomes are you trying to fix the feelings on the inside the internal stuff with the trappings of all the stuff on the outside the internal that is to say do you feel that if you had what your friends have you would be happy and less depressed depression is usually a symptom of something much bigger it is not typically a problem by itself just as a person who experiences a high temperature may likely have a cold so fixing the symptom requires looking at the possible causes in your post you mentioned that you live with your dad are your parents divorced or separated or has your mom passed away either of these circumstances could certainly cause depression finding out when you started feeling depressed might be able to pinpoint the trigger that caused it which requires looking at when you last felt really happy it is also important to keep in mind that as a teenager your emotions are often being experienced very randomly and sometimes without cause it is part of your emotional development but as you grow older can learn how to manage those emotions better and practice doing things that help you feel better without causing harm to yourselfhave you tried talking to your dad about your feelings or maybe another relative if you feel safer doing so do you have a friend who is your best friendsomeone who is there for you no matter what if not there is a service you can use that is a national number for teens to talk with teen peer counselors they are teens like yourself but they have some insights that might be helpful its called teen line httpsteenlineonlineorg it helped me when i was in my teens and has helped lots of other teens as well you might find a place to get some referrals to other local services in your area if you want are in washington state and would like to connect with me directly you call link to me via my profile page or perhaps finding a counselor in your local area might be useful most towns and cities have some form of low cost counseling you might also check with your school for assistancedont be afraid of not always knowing how you are supposed to feel adults dont always have a handle on it either being a teenager carries a lot stress fear and uncertainty but you are not alone and there is help if you reach out for it i wish for you the very best and bright future
im in my late teens and live with my dad the only time i go out is for my college classes sometimes when i see my friends i want to talk with them but sometimes i wont want to talk to them for days or even weeks sometimes i feel im not worth knowing or im never going to do anything right are they right am i depressed,the answer to the question of whether or not youre depressed is less meaningful than what you are doing to feel strong and secure in your lifeotherwise people shortcut themselves to go deeper in understanding who they are and what theyd like to do with their lives and accept depression as though it is their new namewhat you write sounds like classic depressionwhat to do about this feeling is to get closer to yourself in an accepting way  assume that what you do in daily living is somehow necessary  unless you are doing immoral or illegal actions to other people to accept your own wishes as truth will open you to appreciate why you do what you domake believe youre interesting and find out more about who you are if you have trouble to start with thinking of yourself as worth understandingthe more you appreciate who you are and your unique strengths vulnerabilities and fears the more these will dissolve by what seems on their ownin fact they will disappear bc you are believing in yourself and your waysgood luck
im in my late teens and live with my dad the only time i go out is for my college classes sometimes when i see my friends i want to talk with them but sometimes i wont want to talk to them for days or even weeks sometimes i feel im not worth knowing or im never going to do anything right are they right am i depressed,im alway wary of assigning a term to a feeling as often that term becomes more important than the feeling itself from the very little that you have written it is clear that you are going through something that has made you extremely low affected your selfesteem and motivation limits your enjoyment of formerly pleasurable activities and affects your feelings of selfworth all of these are aspects of being depressed though you can be depressed and still not have depression counseling is definitely a place where you can go and sort out why you have had such a sudden a drastic change to your mood sometimes our mood can be effected by changes in our routine losses or significant disappointments talking with someone will not only help you to better understand why you are feeling this way but they will also help you to ground yourself and learn strategies and tools to help you to manage your mood and strategize for the future i do hope that you will reach out feeling alone can be harmful over long periods of time as it can stop us from seeking out the support we need
she has trouble falling and staying asleep and shes always either extremely hungry or not hungry at all she also gets angry and feels like crying really easily for no reason she says she is always kind of down is this depression what can i do to help her,sounds like signs of someone who is depressedsince the person in question is your friend offer your friendship to listen to any situations or feelings she has about herself and the way her life is goingdepressed people are often lonely people and feel as though no one around them cares or notices them  your willingness to be available to her may lift her spirits  feeling loved goes a long way to dissolving depressed feelingsalso if in the beginning when you offer to talk there is a high chance shell be defensive and turn down your offertry again on another day and then another daywhen people feel depressed they usually shut down  so you may need a few or several tries before your friend accepts your offer to show her you care about how she is doingalso watch for signs within yourself that your friends depression is not sinking your emotions  depressed people are draining to be around because they often see and talk about only the negatives and drawbacks of situations
im a teenager and i i go through periods of moodiness i have extreme feelings but i bury them and then i feel nothing  just empty and emotionless i have trust issues low self esteemban extreme fear of abandonment and i constantly reevaluate my relationships i also dont know who i am as a person im not happy overall but im not suicidal can i just feel happy,sometimes the way to feel happy is to address all the questions you just describedteenage years are the first time any of us starts to feel and recognize our uniqueness  the fact that you recognize your great range of feelings as uncomfortable as they may sometimes be is healthyalso healthy is that you are asking for opinions of therapists who would be familiar with when a range of feelings shows an out of the ordinary problemone path to take is to reflect on the topics you wrote here and especially to ask yourself your reasons for how the problem started and what it would take for it to resolvedo you have trust issues because someone broke your trust youre entitled to a repair of your trust by the other person  even if the person never offers this to you to know you deserve to be restored to whole may help you feel more securethe same is true with the other topics abandonment and relationships generallythe more you continue to value your unique understanding expectations and standards the more likely youll create relationships which do not have these qualities and you will restore your sense of hope that other people may treat you in a fair and kind way
i had a very troubled up bringing and im currently dealing with alot right now i know some people may not think so but to me its a lot i feel overwhelmed could this be depression i use to be in therapy as a child alll throughout elementry middle and high school i had counseling 23 times a week i havent be in counseling lately though,what matters most is how you feel and what youre doing with whom youre interacting whether you feel youve got enough interaction to be happywhether or not a clinician would decide to identify you as depressed matters much less than how you actually are feeling if you have some ideas as to what might improve your sense of being and how to go about reaching your goalsif therapy during your childhood made you feel better and you feel you may be depressed then trying therapy at this point in your life makes sensethe worst that can happen is you find you feel better than you first understoodthe best that can happen is you find a caring therapist who helps you find faith in yourself again

my mother is combative with me when i say i dont want to talk with her about my depression she hasnt been supportive of me in the past and she isnt someone that i feel comfortable opening up to she constantly tries to instigate conversations where she asks me questions that i dont want to or cant answer i tell her i dont want to talk and she starts arguments with me how can i get her to understand,your situation sounds extremely frustratingyoure doing the right move to state you dont want to discuss your depression with heri guess you could ask if she would like to know your reason to not speak w her about your depression  if you feel she can handle a reasonable conversation and you would like to tell her your true reason then schedule this or bring up the topic at a neutral time not in the middle of an argumenthaving an unsupportive mom is difficult enough to accept  you may feel greater success and peach of mind to meditate on accepting her lack of understanding than to engage in arguing when she starts this
i just feel sad all the time and i dont like anyone in my family i feel like theyre trying to control me and wont let me grow,hellowhile one can be sad from time to time feeling sad all the time could be a sign of depression if you feel sad on most days it is worthwhile speaking to a psychologist to determine whether you suffer clinical depression feeling sadness is a normal response to loss whether you lose a family friend job or something you deem important in your life however feeling sadness all the time is a signal that you are not happy about something in your life if it is related to your family and often relationship with family members could affect our selfesteem and selfworth then perhaps it is worthwhile exploring what you find unhappy about your relationship with your family is it that you do not feel heard supported or loved is it that you feel disrespected disregarded or feel unimportant these are just a few examples of common issues that people report that contribute to their depression to help you to uncover your reasons for your sadness or depression and to cope with them in a healthier and more constructive way it may be helpful to contact a therapist who could support you with this process you do not have to deal with it alone dr virginia chow montreal psychologist for more information about depression please consult my website at wwwpsychologyresourceca
i just feel sad all the time and i dont like anyone in my family i feel like theyre trying to control me and wont let me grow,understandably the idea of someone who tries to control you is good reason to feel sadyour feelings sound like they are very strong and meaningful in your lifekeep in mind that your feelings about others has more to do with ones own selfview than with what the other person is actually doingunless the people in your family are actually interrupting and impeding your life in practical ways or by intimidation or other verbal ways to inhibit you then there is a great chance your feelings of being controlled by other family members has more to do with your fears to be who you are than with any family members actions
i cant seem to feel any emotion except anxiety not even for myself,thank you for posting  im interested to hear some more information such as if you live by yourself or family if you go to schoolemployedunemployed and what kind of things do you like to do with friends or by yourself  often times when we are experiencing a strong emotion that we interpret as negative we put most of our focus on that negative emotion and struggle to see that we do not always feel that specific emotion  there are typically points in the day even if it is for only in 1 minute intervals when we do not feel that negative emotion  when we overgeneralize we use words like always or never and when we use those words and it may not be totally true we feel the negative emotion based on an inaccuracy which is not fair to you  ask yourself some of these questions am i being realistic when im overgeneralizing things have i ever noticed a short period of time that i wasnt feeling anxious  what do i notice when i am feeling anxious what am i thinking about  when was the last time i felt empathy  what was different when i was able to feel empathy  hopefully this helps get you started
i cant seem to feel any emotion except anxiety not even for myself,empathy usually falls on a spectrum meaning that some people show more than others empathy is the ability to look at the world through someone elses eyes or walk a mile in their shoes there could be some people in your life for whom empathy is easier to feel and those for whom you have no idea what they are experiencingempathy is not usually categorized as an emotion but as something related to emotions for example you could have empathy about someones anxietyim not sure whether you are also referring to the idea that you dont have sympathy for yourself or others thats a different concept but also involves different degreeswhen you say you dont have emotion except anxiety i wonder if you are saying that you have anxiety all the time and it may be covering up other emotions if you are experiencing a lot of anxiety try to look at what it connects to and find something that changes your focus for a few minutes this could be any number of activities such as watching tv cooking reading a book or many other optionsif you are feeling as if you are just going through the motions and not having a lot of emotions about anything if its just been a few days it may just be related to a current stress that will lessen in a few days if it has been quite a while consider tracking your mood and looking at when you do notice changes in your emotions there may be some variations that you are not aware ofif you continue to feel anxious and as if you dont have as many emotions as you would like consider talking with your primary care physician or a local therapist
i cant seem to feel any emotion except anxiety not even for myself,empathy is the ability to tap into our own experience to help us connect with others in order to be aware of how they are experiencing life it is a skill that we learn with practice and refine as we become mature if you are feeling anxious maybe you are able to understand better others who are going trough anxiety but i wonder if instead of feeling empathy you may just want to find ways to reduce your anxiety a good idea is to be very aware of your anxiety triggers and once you identify them explore other ways you could react sera normal que no sienta empatãaparece que no puedo experimentar ninguna otra emociã³n que no sea ansiedad ni si quiera por mã misma empatãa es la habilidad de usar tus propias experiencias para conectarte con otros y estar consciente de la manera que ellos experimentan la vida es una destreza interpersonal que aprendemos y refinamos con la prãctica y segãºn maduramos como personas si te estãs sintiendo ansioso tal vez puedas comprender mejor como otra persona experimenta momentos de ansiedad pero me pregunto si en lugar de estar buscando sentir empatãa realmente quisieras reducir tus niveles de ansiedad una buena manera es estar consciente que activa la ansiedad y ya que lo identifiques explora que otras reacciones pudieras tener
i know i need to deal with my depression but i dont know how and i dont want to tell anyone how can i deal with depression without telling anyone,love yourself more and treat yourself kindly with empathy and compassionusually when people feel depressed they also feel lonely and isolated  since at this time you wouldnt want to tell anyone about the way you feel which includes the possibility that a few of the ones whom you tell would offer you emotional support give this to yourselfalso consider to make a goal of eventually telling someone whom you are reasonably sure would understand and empathize about your depressionthis will help alleviate the sense of shame unworthiness and pervasive guilt which often comes along with depressionsending you good luck

how do i make myself happy without the people who made me happy now that theyre gone i feel sad its been two months now but i seem to be unable to stay okay and independent,hello so someone made you happy but is no longer around i am sure that feels devastating as a counselor i usually have to ponder this kind of thought because it lends itself to suggesting that happiness comes from the external rather than the internal side of a persons life happiness is formed within ourselves all the external trappings of happiness are usually quite fleeting and temporary even relationships fo not last forever if we get to a place where we are reliant and dependent on those around us to create happiness in our lives then we lose the opportunities for us to do it ourselves we are entirely capable of finding ways to be happy sometimes this entails working out issues that are holding us back from reaching a place of peace or resolution to a specific problemwhat i would offer to you is to find ways in which you can develop happiness for yourself what do you like about your life as it is right now what can you do to create change in your life to increase your happiness these kinds of questions can be valuable to you as you seek out ways to make happiness an internal rather than an external event mourning the loss of a social connection in whatever way that occurred is part of the grieving process but it is not permanent it is a path to healing and moving forward from this you can seek out new sources of happiness i encourage you to remember that happiness is independent of the external experience you have in the world happiness is an expression of the internal feelings so that will be the source or the font of positive emotion from which you really draw if you are lacking in happiness then it becomes important to examine why that is and what you can do about it to promote selfcare seeking out a professional counselor can also be a good option as you move through the griefloss process and examine the reasons happiness is not in greater supplyi wish you happiness for every day of your lifebest wishes

i feel like i am internally screaming all the time externally i am calm but i have this intense unidentifiable emotion constantly i dont feel sad i dont cry a lot i feel rather emotionally distant other than the internal screaming it kind of feels like im a caged animal,it is hard to make a definite diagnosis however i would say  that it could be and or a combination of depression stress ptsd etc  more background information would have to be needed  one thing i would say is that you really need to seek guidance from a professional to work through these symptoms  if what you described as a caged animal is released all the crying sadness and controllable emotions will come out  that would not be good when they do  get help before they do
i feel like i am internally screaming all the time externally i am calm but i have this intense unidentifiable emotion constantly i dont feel sad i dont cry a lot i feel rather emotionally distant other than the internal screaming it kind of feels like im a caged animal,as far as the formal diagnosis of depression goes it would be hard to determine without more information it sounds like you are noticing that there is a significant difference between how you are feeling on the inside and how you express yourself outwardly part of you is quite distressed and yet it remains invisible to the outside world almost as if it is trapped inside of your body many people who are depressed experience such things as intrusive thoughts emotional numbness difficulty expressing themselves and bodily tension caged animal in working with a competent therapist you may be able to get more insight into what you are going through the nature of the disconnect between you inner feelings and outer expression and eventually gain relief from the distress as well as a greater sense of connection with yourself and personal freedom
i feel like i am internally screaming all the time externally i am calm but i have this intense unidentifiable emotion constantly i dont feel sad i dont cry a lot i feel rather emotionally distant other than the internal screaming it kind of feels like im a caged animal,it sounds like you are trying to find a label to help you to understand why you are feeling the way you are feeling  sometimes there are no labels for how we feel  sometimes there is no name for the emotions that we are experiencing regardless you do not have to continue to feel this way no matter what you call it  if you are seeking to experience an internal calmness such as your external calmness you may want to try some mindfulness practices or meditation  however being able to get at the root cause of what you are feeling may be what you need to help you release this feeling for the long term  i recommend seeking support for this to allow this internal screaming to get some air and begin to breathe
ive never been able to talk with my parents my parents are in their sixties while i am a teenager i love both of them but not their personalities i feel that they do not take me seriously whenever i talk about a serious event in my life if my dad doesnt believe me then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesnt believe me either im a pansexual but i cant trust my own parents ive fought depression and won however stress and anxiety are killing me i feel that my friends dont listen to me i know they have their own problems which i do my best to help with but they dont always try to help me with mine when i really need them i feel as if my childhood has been taken from me i feel as if i have no one whom i can trust,first of all i am sorry that you have been missing out on your childhood it may help you to know that many of us feel that we have missed out on our childhoods as well and that despite such deprivations for many of us our adult lives have been extraordinarily fulfilling due to our opening up to trusted adults i recommend that you find a trustworthy adult to talk to this may be a teacher a coach a school counselor a minister a family member or a friends family member if none of these are available try out a professional counselor social worker psychiatric nurse practitioner psychologist or a psychiatrist it is best to get a referral for such a professional from a peer who has had a positive and safe experience with a particular provider

people who are parental figures in my life have in the past hurt me and some continue to do so it makes me feel like im not good enough for my husband or the life he provides me i have had jobs but i am going through a lot of my past garbage and trying to figure out when it all went wrong any time i bring these things up i am expected to be over the issue these are people that you cant just cut out but i have never received apologies for so much of my pain i dont know what to do any more i dont know who i am anymore,it sounds like you have been thinking about how past hurts have influenced you and when you try to talk about these hurts with people in your life you are feeling invalidated it also sounds like current conflicts are continuing to leave you feeling hurt and devalued in working with a therapist you may be able to get some clarity about your past who you are and what kinds of boundaries you want in your relationships so that you can lead a life that is more satisfying to you
people who are parental figures in my life have in the past hurt me and some continue to do so it makes me feel like im not good enough for my husband or the life he provides me i have had jobs but i am going through a lot of my past garbage and trying to figure out when it all went wrong any time i bring these things up i am expected to be over the issue these are people that you cant just cut out but i have never received apologies for so much of my pain i dont know what to do any more i dont know who i am anymore,hello adults who come from abusive home histories physical emotional or even psychological may take a long time to heal from that abuse we carry our past with us everywhere we go and it is up to us to find resolutions to past hurts this is often easier said than done but it is possible from the perspective of those with whom you have shared your concerns it might be assumed that based on where you are in life and who you are now that you have already worked through any issues from your younger years some of our deepest scars in life are indeed invisible and suppressed we have to get to the place where we can take care of the inner child that is still hurting by recognizing that those who hurt us  however they did might have had their own challenges which prevented them from functioning and behaving in ways we might have deeply needed those who have directly hurt you may not be capable of acknowledging and understanding how you were affected by their actions  even in the worst of cases they themselves may be doing what they can either out of shame or heartbreak for their own actions to work on forgetting how they behaved toward you all those years before how are they behaving toward you now can you find it in your heart to forgive those who have hurt you forgiveness is the gift we give ourselves and isnt dependent on an apology from an offender by forgiving even in the absence of any apology we are releasing the weight of the burden we are carrying that reflects the offense we feel was committed against us sometimes therapy can be helpful in this process talking with someone who can be nonjudgmental and reflects an empathetic position toward you might be what you need right now seeking out a therapist to help you work through these negatives feelings and thoughts is much easier than trying to go it alone i would encourage you to reach out and find someone who resonates with you on that journey so that you can begin a path toward healingwarm regardsshawn berthel ms lmhc

i am going through a very hard time and im so depressed my parents are getting a divorce and a lot of bad things are happening i want to lull myself,consider yourself quite normal for feeling overwhelmed and depressed about your parents divorce  this is the most natural way to feel at this timedepending on how old you are and whether you live under their roof  are dependent on their support and are either part of the decision or not of with whom and where you will live start considering these pointshow did you find out about the upcoming divorceare either of your parents reluctant to answer your questions or is it clear that neither of them want to talk about anything with youwhatever your fears and questions about your own future these are all real  it is necessary for you to know about your basic futureif you are living on your own and the main problem is your inner adjustment that your family structure is completely changing then probably a good therapist would be a great help to you now to clarify these tensionssending lots of good wishes for an easy resolution to your new path
my depression has been reoccurring for a long time it all started when i was being bullied in high school in ninth grade my principal told me i needed to stay home for a couple days to protect myself while she spoke to my classmates i needed professional help for my stress because i was having crying spells from the stress of going to school and confronting my classmates after that i was fine for a couple of years i entered my first year of college in a really tough program with high demands of expected work i believe my depression rebooted from there with the stress i began to cut myself because a friend of mine at the time told me how she used to do the same and it used to feel good for her obviously that wasnt the right choice i regret ever doing that seeing as even though im not selfharming anymore i always look back at that time whenever i feel very stressed i have a big problem with handling problems in life whenever a problem arises i get stressed and i feel hopeless as if its not going to get better i get way too stressed from my problems which leads to overreacting a lot especially when talking to others which then leads to depression i have a hard time coping with stress because i know that if i could handle it easily then i wouldnt be sad all the time and i would say and do the right thing instead of overreacting to my loved ones,i couldnt help but notice that you did not specify your age so i am unable to set the total chronological order and length that you have suffered in this way but i want to start by commending you on seeking out additional coping techniques on your own  unfortunately it sounds like you were offered some that were more dangerous than helpful but be proud that you were able to curb those before they caused too much harm from what you have written stress has always been a difficult thing for you to manage  often when i am working with those who offer the same concern there is a degree of people pleasing that comes with that stress  when we are trying to make others happy especially when we are unable to distinguish the proper rules for success it can make even the simplest of tasks overwhelming stress management is just that management of our own anxieties about the needs of others about our skills and the ability to complete a task and having multiple requests at any given time each of these aspects requires a separate sets of tools to manage them accordingly for example assertiveness communication training could aid in communicating with your colleagues to manage their expectations of your deadlines and abilities but it will not assist you with managing your own anxieties try to separate the different areas of the problem in order to help yourself to find a solution and work on them in their own time perhaps keeping a journal will help you to better understand why you are so easily overwhelmed by stress and help you track some of your lesshelpful responses to stress for example does a certain persons style of communication always make you feel undervalued and therefore push you to finish their requests first is there a certain time of the day where you start to fall off in productivity  is that the time fo the day where you also tend to pile up your requirementstry to ask yourself some of these harder questions and see where they lead you
ive been depressed for quite a while ive been trying to work through it and my boyfriend has been my rock he is honestly the only person i trust enough to talk to about anything but he decided to break up with me because of my depression i cannot afford to see a therapist or anything so he saw no hope in staying with me my insurance has a 5000 deductible so im screwed ive had everything from suicidal thoughts to trying to quit my job i have no one my family doesnt care about me they kicked me out when i turned 18 a few years ago i had friends but they have all moved on with their lives and have no time for me my exboyfriend is trying to help but is making things worse because every time i see or hear him i break down into tears i found out that i will never be promoted now because of my depression,it sounds like you have been struggling with this for quite some time using many of the same coping techniques that feel tried and true to no avail often we fall back on coping techniques that would be helpful in other problems stress social anxieties etc for our depression but the truth is that depression requires its own little tool kit depression is allencompassing and based on what youve written the symptoms are already affecting work and your personal life in myriad ways  the best route forward would be to seek out counselling admittedly but if your insurance deductible is too high that can be very expensive i would recommend contacting your employee assistance program eap if offered by your employer if not you can look into community centres for counselling options check if your doctor will give you a referral or your local religious organization if however you are motivated to get your depression under control there are some great workbooks out there that you can use on your own or with your therapist as long as your therapist is trained in cognitive behavioural therapy or cbt such as mind over mood
after he got home from the hospital he was angry then for a time wonderful now he is depressed and hopeless again,hello and thank you for your question this is a very serious time i dont mean to frighten you but you are right to be concerned the time right after people leave the hospital after receiving psychiatric services is a time of high risk for suicide it is very important after hospitalization to get followup care with a professional as soon as possible if your husband has an established therapist this is the time to call it is also a good time to alert your support system of friends family clergy or others to let them know he is still struggling this is good support for him and youit is important to think about means and opportunity to make another attempt means really do matter so if you have a firearm in the home it is really important to remove it you cant remove all things that a person may hurt themselves with but some things are more lethal than others firearms are very lethal i am not sure what means he used last time but try to reduce the opportunity for him to access it again this is where your support system can help out people can take turns hanging out with him until you are sure the crisis is overif you believe that an attempt is going to occur talk to your husband about going back to the hospital if he refuses you will want to find out what your options are to have him go even if he doesnt want to i know the thought of that really hurts but it can save his life calling 911 is always a good option if you are not sure usually a suicide crisis meaning they want to harm themselves right now lasts a few minutes hours or days sometimes when you get them through the crisis stage they no longer want to commit suicide but as you are indicating that feeling of wanting to commit suicide can come back again so it is always good to have a plan if you want more information call the national suicide prevention lifeline they will always answer 18002738255 they can help you create a specific safety plan i do hope things work out alright be well robin j landwehr dbh lpcc ncc
after he got home from the hospital he was angry then for a time wonderful now he is depressed and hopeless again,this is actually more common then we often realize and actually understandable as he has gone through a trauma an unresolved existential crisis  he was taken care of by others and now is again left alone with his own internal and rather horrific inner strugglein my work with cct or contextual conceptual therapy see wwwsuicidetherapycom i have learned how trapped suicidal people are in their own isolation also called a mysterious isolation a form of self protection which cuts the off from their self or spirit  and unless they address this message from their soul accompany a guide on a journey to discover their own missing information that is to recognize how their own uncomforted emotional pain has resulted in a coping stategy which has effectively cut themselves off from their own beauty their self and their ability to receive love from themselves and others their attempt to kill themselves is a cry from their soul or spirit that they cannot live the life they are living any longer  they take this literally and try to end their life when in fact what their soul or spirit is saying is they need to begin to live the life they came here to live
after he got home from the hospital he was angry then for a time wonderful now he is depressed and hopeless again,im thankful to read your husband found care and that his suicide attempt wasnt successful  while he was hospitalized and prior to his release your husband wouldve been provided in writing a selfcare action plan this typically includes things like committing to a contract not to harm and what to do if he felt overwhelmed by his anger depression and hopelessness eg call 911 call therapist go to nearest hospital emergency department additionally his protocol wouldve provided instructions for his taking medications as directed having a followup appointments with his psychiatristpsychologistclinical social worker and participating in some form of small group support if your husbands struggling as you describe and you are feeling overwhelmed or frightened for his your safety id encourage you to seek immediate assistance
after he got home from the hospital he was angry then for a time wonderful now he is depressed and hopeless again,this must be so difficult for both of you  watching someone you love suffer so profoundly can bring up lots of difficult feelings  without knowing what you are already doing i have a few thoughts to share with you first and foremost know that you cannot fix this for him and get support for yourselfas much as you are able make space in your relationship for him to talk about what he is experiencing  he might not want to talk and that is okif he wants to talk try to listen without judgement and without trying to talk him out of his feelings  focus on validating his feelings and just sitting with him in his painlet him know how you feelthat you love him that you care that you are concerned that this is scary for you too that you are herei hope that this is helpful  on my website wwwsarahmcintyrelpccom ive written a series of blog posts about coping with distress  the techniques ive written about there may be supportive for you and your husband  sending warm wishes your way  sarah
after he got home from the hospital he was angry then for a time wonderful now he is depressed and hopeless again,i appreciate that you are concerned about your husbands emotions and want to support him as best you can right now i imagine that you must be going through your own difficult time too youve had a complicated shock and trauma in your life and in your marriage its normal for both of your emotions to move from hope to despair to fear anger gratitude there is no wrong way to feel and there is no particular pattern your emotions or his will follow try not to assume what he is feeling but ask him instead how are you doing today is something that can be asked over and over again and your love and compassion for him will come through if he has a hard time talking you can share your observations i notice youre more withdrawn this worries me certainly it will help you if you know what hes thinking and feeling because he hid his intentions to hurt himself its normal that you want to know if there is depression and hopelessness this likely was part of what led to his initial despair there is help out there depression is treatable and seeking that treatment is important right now at this vulnerable time this is the kind of complex situation that can be assisted by a therapist who is qualified to help you both understand and manage your emotions whether your husband seeks help or not i hope that you do
after he got home from the hospital he was angry then for a time wonderful now he is depressed and hopeless again,a failed suicide attempt is commonly thought of as a œcry for help however it can also be a serious attempt to find a permanent solution to depression hopelessness or other feelings a person feels are unbearable its wonderful that you want to support your husband but if your husband is feeling depressed and hopeless you can best help him by getting him to a mental health professional feelings of hopelessness and depression and previous attempts at suicide are all risk factors for future suicide attempts with a mental health professional or in the emergency room of a hospital your husband should be evaluated for suicidal thoughts intent and plan and if he is a danger to himself he should probably be hospitalized again until he is stable without knowing the particulars your husband may suffer from major depressive disorder or some other illness on the depressive spectrum in that case medication could help him immensely at which point you can offer your support and encouragement him to practice gentle selfcare and do not forget to practice it for yourself  remember a suicide attempt not only affects the person but it is an immense stressor for his or her loved ones as well as they say œput your oxygen mask on first then you will be better able to provide your husband with calm and loving care and attentionkayla schwartz lmswemail protected

i no longer carry expressions on my face and my emotions are decreasing the more i have fights with my fiancãe,sometimes repressing anger can lead to depression and block all kinds of other emotions too  i would wonder about your experience with anger and if youve ever been discouraged from expressing anger  i would also wonder if you feel like you have space to express yourself in your relationship or if you feel like you really arent being heard  its hard to feel cared for and connected to someone else when you dont feel accepted by them
i no longer carry expressions on my face and my emotions are decreasing the more i have fights with my fiancãe,sometimes when we fight a lot with our partner it becomes more uncomfortable to share emotions because it feels like it will lead to another flight or disagreementyou could try having a conversation when youre not fighting and starting it out by saying that you would like to discuss something important to you and see if your fiancãe is open to thatsomething else is that you could have an agreement that if one of you is having a really strong emotions in a difficult conversation and would like to break from the conversation you could agree ahead of time that youll say that you would like a timeout and will come back to discuss the issue in a certain amount of time usually about an hour and then try to resume the discussion the reason this can work is it can give you a chance to calm down and then still go back to the discussion rather than not talking about it again this only works if both of you agree to that before something starts though
im depressed i have been for years i hide it from everyone because im scared of the reactions ill get last time i tried telling my parents it was a huge argument about me being too young to be depressed im a legal adult calling me ungrateful and telling me that if i cant handle things now its only going to get worse in the future which is turning out to be true its exhausting pretending to be okay and i dont know how much longer i can try im just really tired and sadly i cant afford the help i need on my own,hi georgia theres a really good lesson here people tell us things and we tend to think thats the truthbut its not ill do some translating for youyoure so ungrateful means i need you to be successful and happy in order for me to feel im a good parentyoure too young to be depressed means i dont want to deal with your mental health issues right now ill pretend its not happening so i dont have to face my fear and shameits only going to get worse just means i dont know how to support you beyond scaring you into wanting to at least fake happiness for my sakeyour parents are being unsupportive not because youre not suffering but because this is all theyre capable of right now they are not where you will find the support you need so keep looking for it in other places its out there if might be an aunt or a friend or a friends aunt it might be a therapist or a bus driver or your family doctor keep looking for someone who will hear you i hope you dont ever give up

i have terrible anxiety and depression ive tried various therapists and pills but nothings helped,is it possible you simply didnt mix well with the particular therapists with whom youve worked  if this is possible interview a therapist before  starting therapy  then you will be choosing a therapist who feels compatible with your way of seeing yourself and your lifealso therapy isnt for everyoneread about the different healing modalities and see if one of these speaks to your interest in feeling betterwhat matters most is finding among all the legitimate healing methods what you believe will be effective
i have terrible anxiety and depression ive tried various therapists and pills but nothings helped,im sorry that you have tried several different things and not had much reliefi will say that there are several different types of medications that may help and each therapist is different so it is quite possible that a different combination of things youve already tried may be helpfuli would encourage you to continue trying different therapists i would say to give each one at least six sessions before you decide that the approach that they are using is not working for you also most places have a certain sort of structured initial session that must be done but after that the decisions are largely up to what you and the clinician feel is helping if something is or is not working communicate this with your therapist this is a big deal most therapists i know actually welcome this feedbackthere is a fair amount of research into the idea that the therapeutic alliance the relationship that you have in the context of working through the reasons that brought you into therapy is very important also sometimes anxiety and depression can make it difficult to go to therapy on a regular basis if that is something with which you are struggling i would encourage you to talk about that as wellin addition to a solid relationship with a therapist who you connect with you may consider trying something like yoga or meditation mindfulness is sometimes helpful as wellheres a link to questions for finding suitable therapists httpwwwpharmatherapistcom12tipsforfindingasuitabletherapist
im in my early 20s ive worked since two months after i turned 18 i have œplans i could become an electrician or i could operate heavy machinery i have goals but i do nothing to try to meet them because i dont feel i can i just want a better life for my fiancãe and the kids than i did,for starters commend yourself for being committed to working you have no idea what is going to happen in the next second so focusing on thinking you will never have a good career or amount to anything financially is creating a fictitious story  remind yourself of that every time the thought pops up  the false belief that nothing good will happen is sucking out energy you can use on pursuing your career dreams next do you know what you need to do to become an electrician or heavy machinery operator if not find out then set up a realistic schedule for yourself to accomplish the steps as you accomplish each step see your progress  notice that you are moving closer to your goal  every day remind yourself why you are pursuing this career  in fact write it down and tape it on your bathroom mirror  when you start to feel discouraged remember your goal and remind yourself that you have no idea if youll make it or not but you are going to give it everything you have to find out anything worth pursuing is going to take a lot of persistence and hard work stay with it you and your family are worth it
he said he would try and he never did its been nine months and this is making me worse today he said i have to respect whatever decision he makes is that true am i supposed to respect the decision to leave because he cant handle what im going through and leaves me here crying and worried every night hes constantly changing his mind on if he wants to work it out,wow that is tough there is nothing worse than fearing abandonment when you are already struggling with depression it sounds like you are still wanting to work through whatever challenges you and your husband are having but your husband may not be on the same page i would encourage you and your husband to seek professional support if you havent already while depression can put real strains on a relationship relationship problems can lead to or contribute to depression and there may be some real benefits to both of you in doing some couple therapy with that being said  if your husband is not willing to do therapy or is clear that he wants the relationship to end then i cant see what choice you have but to respect his decision as you mentioned this doesnt mean that you have to feel okay with the decision  as im sure you wouldnt  but ultimately loving one another and staying in committed relationships is a choice that we each have to make if he is wanting to leave  this could make things a lot tougher for you i would encourage you to seek professional support for yourself and reach out to lots of friends and family you do not need to face depression alone  nor should you have to we all need support at tough times like these

im in my late 50s i never loved or have been loved i need deeper help than is offered in my small town but i cannot leave this town because of agoraphobia i find myself losing hope more and more my brain barely works anymore and my memory so small i forget in a moment i serve no purpose im incapable of work or anything of value and i never have been im a complete waste of time and resources and yet i keep trying why why does god insist that i continue to exist im not suicidal just tired,the fact that youre reaching out says that there is something in you that wants this to be different and that drive might be something worth tapping into why do i keep trying is a question that might give you some insight into what it is in you that keeps you going a lot of therapistscounselors are now offering video therapy as long as youre in the same state as a therapist offering this service you could connect with someone helpful from the comfort of your home even being in your small town id recommend looking into this option because youre asking a lot of really deep questions and might benefit from having those conversations with someone who can help you find your own answers
im in my late 50s i never loved or have been loved i need deeper help than is offered in my small town but i cannot leave this town because of agoraphobia i find myself losing hope more and more my brain barely works anymore and my memory so small i forget in a moment i serve no purpose im incapable of work or anything of value and i never have been im a complete waste of time and resources and yet i keep trying why why does god insist that i continue to exist im not suicidal just tired,hi oak harbormy heart goes out to you sometimes when im working with a client who experiences depression or anxiety i ask them for a glimpse into their worst moments in their minds what are the worst thoughts that run through your head often they struggle perhaps out of shame maybe they dont want me to know their worst thoughts but i can help them better if i do know because then we have a place to work from you are feeling hopeless and worthless and your thoughts support these intense emotions i dont know you but i strongly believe that you have someone in your life who if they heard your thoughts would say thats not true i know where her value is i believe that there are people who would see your value clearly even if in small things can you imagine those voicesyou mentioned god so lets invite god into the conversation what might god say to you what evidence might godwho sees allhave of your worth what hint might god give you about your purpose you suffer from severe anxiety and the agoraphobia works together with fear theyre a tag team fear tells you perhaps that people will reject you or something equally bad and then agoraphobia steps in and traps you and uses as evidence the fact that no one seems to be reaching out to you to convince you that you have no worth do you see their plan make her scared keep her here aloneconvince her its hopeless they both try to convince you that they are your only friends except theyre lying to you they only want power over youyou forget your worth you forget that we all have worth no one is a waste i believe all gods creatures have worth and that were here to use our gifts to improve the world and to remind each other of our value there are people out there needing your support as much as you need theirs can you find them my guess is youve been alone and isolated for a very long time and its impossible for you to see your worth in this situation we need mirrors to see our worth and other people are our mirrors we see our value in their eyes do you remember the first time you questioned your worth what was happening that you blamed yourself for can you speak to that child and tell her or him that whatevers happening isnt her fault its that child who cannot see her own worth probably because someone treated her as though she had none thats only a story though not the truth can you find another thread of a story who might tell a story of your worthoak harbor i believe that there is help closer than you think fear wants you to believe its hopeless you reached out herecan you reach out again start with just one person and that will lead you to somewhere we dont know where that somewhere is but could it be better than sitting alone youve stopped living you can choose any moment to start i wish you peace and hope 
both of my parents committed suicide together and i was the one who found them i suffer from overwhelming depression which is having an extreme effect on me and my husbands sex lives he does not understand at all and is always making me feel so uncomfortable about sex,hello and thank you for your question first i want to tell you how sorry i am for the experience you had with your parents that is a grief and trauma that is certainly hard to imagine trauma and grief can affect us in many ways and certainly deeply personal things like our sex lives it may be difficult for others to make the connection but it is there so for example if stress and trauma make you feel like you are not interested in sex a partner may take it as a personal rejection rather than response to stress trauma or grief if your husband will agree to it couples counseling may be your best bet a counselor can help you with your communication and may be able to provide some education to your husband about trauma and how it can have an impact on intimacy if he doesnt agree to go it may be worth it to go on your own you still have a lot you are dealing with yourself and sometimes our personally therapy can influence others so it may be a good idea it is important to remember that even though you are married you have the right to make decisions about your body and that includes when you want to have sex with it i hope this is helpful and some of my colleagues may have ideas also be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
i have bipolar disorder paranoid personality disorder posttraumatic stress disorder anxiety and obsessivecompulsive disorder i last selfharmed a week ago when i am stressed overwhelmed hurt or angry the urge to selfharm is all i can think of i am trying to seek help,seeking professional help does not mean that you will necessarily be admitted into an inpatient setting  though  to be honest that can become an option if you feel unsafe or if you are unable to plan for safety however many clients who struggle with selfharm can find help in outpatient settings  particularly those which offer a treatment called dialectical behavioral therapy dbt looking for a dbt professional or group therapy setting may be particularly helpful but a skilled professional can help you to figure out how to identify other options even when you are experiencing overwhelming emotions without knowing your location i also recommend searching to find your local helpline or suicide prevention hotline the volunteers on the other end of the line can be very helpful even if your intention is not suicide and they are likely also to be able to connect you with resources in your area calling into the helpline may also be a first step alternative to selfharming when youre feeling overwhelmed
i stress over everything if i dont have enough quality time with my boyfriend i start to feel resentment towards him he has three children and they are great kids but i find we dont have much time together i break down easily and find myself depressed,everyone has some level of anxiety  its what helps us respond to stressors in our lives and clues us into the fact that we need to respond to something going on however if youre feeling overwhelmed by racing thoughts feeling like you spend a lot of energy worrying about something specific or even pretty much anything at all and youre starting to find that its getting in your way when it comes to living your life the way you want then id suggest seeing a counselor or therapist for an assessment for anxiety your other concerns though seem pretty normal for someone who is in a relationship with a partner who has children as a married stepmother ive been there and as a therapist i can tell you that the boundaries and communication skills you have in your relationships need to be healthy for you to feel healthy finding some support from a group of others whose partners have children might be really helpful  being able to hear from others that you arent alone in feeling like this can really lighten the load and they might have some good ideas for handling certain situations another option is to find a counselor or therapist who has experience working with stepblended family dynamics  because even if youre not officially married those dynamics come into play whenever there are kids from another relationship involved you may even consider couples counseling so that both of you can learn to talk about your relationship needs and concerns in a way that will encourage connection and strengthen your sense of partnership

i am pretty sure i have depression and anxiety i also have voices in my head i have problems sleeping too ive already been diagnosed with attentiondeficit disorder and obsessivecompulsive disorder i have selfharmed in the last and used to be suicidal how do i tell them this and ask for therapy,if you have already been diagnosed with attentiondeficit disorder and obsessivecompulsive disorder can you go back to the people who diagnosed you with those thingsit may be that your parents would be open to you talking with someone because it sounds like you have done this in the past i dont know whether you have a specific reason that you are thinking they may have some hesitation but if you are comfortable saying that you would really like to talk to someone because you are feeling sad or anxious or whichever of your concerns you feel comfortable revealing to them that may be a way to start the process as for how you tell them about the fact that you have harmed yourself in the past and used to be suicidal a therapist may be able to work together with you to discuss the best way to tell them about thatim not sure if you have told anyone about what you have been experiencing but if you have some support there perhaps they would be able to give you feedback about ways to talk with your parents as wellyou mentioned that sometimes you hear voices this can happen for a variety of reasons but if the voices that you hear are giving you directions and you feel as though you might follow them that would be a time to ask for immediate help before you follow through with what they are telling you perhaps by calling 8002738255 they may be able to connect you with local resources and they can definitely talk with you in the moment that you call
i am pretty sure i have depression and anxiety i also have voices in my head i have problems sleeping too ive already been diagnosed with attentiondeficit disorder and obsessivecompulsive disorder i have selfharmed in the last and used to be suicidal how do i tell them this and ask for therapy,family support is very helpful when having these symptoms  i suggest looking for therapist within reach school through your insurance or the community calling 211  once you schedule a session you can inform them and invite them to come in  i have found trough sceptic parents that once they give it a chance they open up to the process of learning and healing i also understand that parents may become overly concerned and overprotective when hearing about your symptoms and thats why is important to discuss them with a therapist normalize them understand why you experience them and learn how they could help you cã³mo les digo a mis padres que yo pienso que tengo problemas mentalesestoy seguro que tengo depresiã³n ansiedad tambiãn escucho voces en mi cabeza tengo problemas para dormir tambiãn y he sido diagnosticado con dãficit de atenciã³n y desorden obsesivo compulsivo me he auto flagelado y solãa tener ideas suicidas como les dejo saber y les pido ayudael apoyo de la familia es muy ãºtil cuando se experimentan los sãntomas que mencionas te sugiero que busques un consejero en la escuela a travãs de tu plan mãdico o en la comunidad llamando al 211  ya que tengas tu cita invita a tus padres he observado que aunque algunos padres son escãpticos al principio pero una vez le dan una oportunidad se abren al proceso de terapia y sus beneficios tambiãn he observado que algunos padres se vuelven sobreprotectores cuando aprenden de los sãntomas que sufren sus hijos asã que serãa otro beneficio que aprendieran que pueden hacer para ayudarte y apoyarte

im depressed and recently went through a break up its like every guy i like only wants me for sex i think im ugly and sometimes i just want to die i have a son and i got really big when i was pregnant i have stretch marks on my stomach,if you are currently feeling as if you want to die please call 8002738255 and talk to someoneone way to work on not always thinking so negatively about yourself is to surround yourself with people who are more positive toward you do you have friends or family who are supportivecan you find one part of you that you do not think is uglyif your stretch marks are still bothering you talk with a pharmacist or your primary care physician sometimes there are creams or lotions you can use to decrease stretch marks and they should be able to guide you in the right directionyou mentioned mostly physical things here i wonder if you can find one small thing each day that is going right and build from there perhaps your son makes you smile
im not the same anymore i dont know how to get back to who i am im sad and confused and angry and tired i dont sleep well,being tired can really affect almost everyones ability to work through things that make them sad confused or angry among other emotions if youre having difficulty sleeping try to get into a habit of going to bed and waking up close to the same time every day also consider only using the bed for sleeping so your brain knows that its time to sleep when you are in bed if you are not sleeping while you are in bed consider getting up and reading a book or doing something to make you tired before going back to bed hopefully youll be able to establish a patternsometimes sadness and other emotions make sleeping very difficult as well try keeping track of your moods to see what is leading up to the changesif youre still struggling consider talking with a therapist about the specifics andor maybe talking with your primary care physician there are natural sleep remedies that he or she may recommend for you
over the years i have slowly lost everything my jobs my cars my freedom and my money i am a stayathome mom who doesnt make any money doesnt have a car never goes out and cleans all day long everyday,there are an infinite number of possibilities here you included a lot of things that you dont have is there anyway that you can have some freedom for a few hours a week at least a lot of times stay at home moms have groups when they meet at different public places where their children can play together and they can talk together i dont know how old your child or children isare but perhaps going back to work is something that can happen in the futurei wonder if you may consider who you have in your life who can support you i dont know whether you have a spouse or parents or siblings who could help out with some different things i wonder if you could consider where you would like to go if you had two or three hours that you could do whatever you wanted if you can sort out some possible answers to that maybe you can work together with friends or family to make it happenalso again depending on the age of your children some parents can do things while the children are sleeping even if you are in the same room for example if your children are sleeping for about two hours maybe 30 minutes of that could be reserved for you and the rest could be for cleaning or other things you need to do
i dont have time to live or take care of myself at times its causing depression stress and anxiety i dont know what to do,im not sure whether you are referring to having a lot of activities after school or that homework is overwhelming can you set aside a couple hours a week for yourself as a place to start
two years ago i was separated from the military into my contract for medical issues it has emotionally destroyed me i now basically hate myself its embarrassing to be separated from the one place who takes anyone my family has been in the armed forces and it has always been my dream i cant do this alone anymore and now my family is even worried,it sounds like being separated from the armed forces is a major loss for you it takes some time to work through the emotions related to this and it often takes longer if you are trying to work through it without a lot of supportis there a task that you were doing during your military service that can in some way transfer into civilian life i dont know what else your life involves whether you have close friends or a romantic partner a career activities that you like to do and many other things you may be able to use some of the things that you still have today as a way to start moving forward in a different directionyour military service will always be a part of you thank you for your service
i feel depressed even though i act like a happy with my family i act like im happy so my son doesnt see me sad i act like my life is a happy life but i feel sad and depressed i sometimes think of killing myself and that my family deserve someone better than me i just cry and write in my book all these feelings,it sounds like you have several different things happening at the same time i would encourage you to call and speak to a local therapist if you are having thoughts of killing yourself in this moment please call 8002738255 and talk to someonewhile i follow that you would like your son to be unaware of what you are going through that doesnt mean that you cant discuss your feelings with someone else who is it that you trust or could speak with about this a therapist could be one person but perhaps there is someone else in your life as wellone thing that may help is to find a bead or rock that is smooth and you can hold onto it while thinking of a specific memory where you were happy this could be from as long ago as necessary as long as it is specific and you can place yourself back in that time when you are thinking about it if you think about this time while holding onto the bead the bead may remind you of a time when you felt happy you could do the same thing for a time when you felt comfortable and safehave you recognized any patterns for what is leading you to be sadcan you think of anything that makes you feel good even if it only works for a few minutes
i think i may suffer from depression and it is affecting my life and sleep i am on my parents insurance and they wont let me see a therapist because they dont believe in it,the answer here really depends upon your age and something called the age of consent in the state where you live in pennsylvania anyone over the age of 14 can provide consent for their own treatment as for billing purposes try talking to some local agencies if you are under 18 you may be able to have medicaid out of medical necessity so that you can have treatment if you are over 18 there may be some discounted rates at some agencies because of the situation youre in maybe your primary care physician will be able to refer you to some local agenciesif you are in school you may be able to talk with a guidance counselor or someone at the school this would not require using your insurance
when im sad and alone i want to cut myself,try doing something physical if you havent exercised before it is a good idea to get your doctors approval first but this can be helpfulthe more you can find out about when you want to cut the easier it will be to figure out what else you can do if you are feeling sad or angry or nervous look at what is leading up to those feelings and talk to someone about thatyou said you are alone i would see if you can find someone that you can trust to talk with about what you are going through this could be a parent a friend someone at school a coworker or any number of other people
i stopped for a while but ive started doing it again its like an addiction the more i try to stop the more i want to do it ive tried doing some of the stuff they say to do like draw but it doesnt work,ive heard people say that they cut themselves as a way to feel relief from different emotions youre also right that when you try to focus on just not cutting it becomes more difficult because its what you are focused on while that is still something to work on it may also be helpful to find something else you can do instead you said drawing doesnt work for you sometimes more physical activities such as doing a few jumping jacks can be helpful if you dont exercise it might be something to talk with your doctor about firstthe more you can learn about what makes you want to cut the easier it will be to find out what you could do to change that try talking to somebody about what you are feeling in addition to the urge to cut
i have friends family i live in a good home i go to a nice high school and i get pretty good grades but i dont know why im so unhappy these friends are my best friends and theyre all amazing people and yet im sad all the time and feel alone,i wonder if you have moments where you feel happyyou say you have amazing friends i wonder if you get along with them and feel as though you can be yourself around themsometimes we put a lot of pressure on ourselves to do really well at everything all the time and this can be overwhelming sometimes where do you have support i hope you can tell someone that you are feeling sad so that you can talk about your feelingssleeping can make a big difference as far as feeling sad as well if youre not sleeping well at night that could be a big part of feeling sad a lotperhaps you could try to find a person or two who makes you feel totally safe and comfortable and try to talk with them
i used to be the funny guy of the groupthe class clown if you will i used to laugh uncontrollably all the time and be able to be social without it feeling awkward now i cant laugh at all and im dead inside,if you look back to when you feel as though you were the funny guy i wonder what is different now it may be that responsibilities have changed or any number of other thingsi dont know whether youre also saying that you feel sad or if youre saying that you feel as though you dont have any big changes in your feelingsa lot of us tend to be really busy and sometimes we over schedule ourselves to the point that we dont have time to have positive time for ourselves sometimes even if we are spending time with friends were thinking about work and all of the other things we need to doi wonder if it feels awkward when youre with friends that you trust in an environment that you are used to maybe if that is more comfortable for you it can be a stepping stone to focusing on how you feel better in those momentsit sounds as if you may have had an experience or more than one where you felt misunderstood or criticized and now reacting to people feels awkward if so try going back to people you trust who do you have support from
im starting to think that i might have depression the thing is though im not exactly sad i can joke with my friends and stuff but ive stopped caring about my work and ive been starting to think that life is pointless i really have no clue if i need help or if im just tired or something,it is possible that you have depression but you could also be experiencing some other changes that mean that you have feelings of being sad without actually being depressed your statement makes it sound like youve stopped caring about your work but youre still going to work and doing your work it almost sounds like you are dissatisfied with your work do you like what you do when you said that life is pointless what makes it that way what is keeping you going is there something you can do each day that you can find meaning inyou mentioned that you are not sure if you need help or are just tired it sounds like you could certainly benefit from talking with someone about more specificsim curious about how long you have felt this way and if you are aware of anything that is contributing to it
in the last ten months ive been kicked out moved around three times worked many jobs stopped school to make money had dad and mom get sick was cheated on while pregnant lost my baby had relationship issues and was betrayed i cant get a job i have no friends i feel lonely and isolated ive been dealing with all this by myself,one thing that may help is to focus on small things that you do have control over if you can hold onto that sense of having control over what you wear or what you choose to eat or where you go during the day this may help you be able to look at what is currently most important for you and consider different choices for example you say you cant get a job but i wonder if you could work with and local agencies to help you find a job like career link you say you have no friends currently are there any previous friends that you can get back in contact withyou mentioned that you have no friends is there anyone in your life that you can talk with even if its not someone that you consider a closest friend

i started having anxiety three months ago im new to having anxiety and its making me depressed,i agree with cory acceptance and commitment therapy act does seem to help a lot of people who struggle with anxiety its not the only type of therapy that can help but it seems to help people in a way that is more natural and realistic as cory mentioned anxiety is something that is part of life so therapies that indicate we can get rid of it are questionable our natural inclination when we have anxiety is to stop any and all things that may cause it or provoke it we do this because we think it will help but it actually doesnt anxiety usually has us rehashing the past or rehearsing the future while ignoring the present act helps folks who have those kinds of tendencies be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
i started having anxiety three months ago im new to having anxiety and its making me depressed,as a past sufferer of anxiety myself i have learned that it is a natural part of life it is a natural part of us the longer we try to run from it the more it entangles us in its clutches if we deny certain parts of ourselves we will become depressed or even oppressed the only way to deal with anxiety is to embrace it and accept it and in fighting the fight without fighting we will eventually win i would encourage you to look into acceptance and commitment therapy your answer i think lies in that area of research hope this helpsc
i have no friends no hobbies and no interest in anything i get annoyed with everything and everyone i am always tired i can sleep 8 hrs or 12 hrs and im still tired i dont know what to do is this normal,hello and thank you for your question it certainly sounds like you dont like how things are going here are a few thoughts and ideas1 if you havent seen a primary care provider in a while you may want to there are health conditions that can affect your mood and energy levels even at your age it doesnt hurt to get checked out if they find the cause they may be able to treat it and improve the symptoms in addition most primary care providers are trained to be able to manage medication for patients who have mild moderate and sometimes severe depression so dont be surprised if your primary care doctor offers to put you on an antidepressant if they diagnose you with depression medication is not the only way to treat depression but sometimes it is necessary depending on different factors2 you may want to consider counseling since it is another effective way to treat depression a counselor will help you explore the factors that may be leading to depressive symptoms in the first place this could include thoughts behaviors beliefs life experiences and other things 3 finally to answer your question about whether these feelings are normal these symptoms could be the sign of an underlying general health or mental health condition it is important to remember that even if these symptoms are abnormal it doesnt mean that you are millions of people struggle with depression so remember the symptoms are the problem not you hope this helps be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
i have a lot on my mind but all i want to do is stay locked in my room and not socialize with anyone why do i feel so alone,it has been said that depression is often the result of a blocked goal  often people struggle with both anxiety and depression but have difficulty determining which is the most important issue for some depression is the result of frequently blocked goals and when their predominant issues are evaluated they discover that they are anxious worried about a lot of areas in their life but seem to find no relief  when there is no relief and there have been numerous attempts either in their mind or in practical application to resolve the anxiety depression is often the result  in this type of case depression is not the main or underlying issue the anxiety is the underlying issue  having a lot on my mind sounds like anxiety unresolved anxiety can lead to feelings of depression which are often associated with emptiness  in the question above i would want to evaluate all of the issues surrounding having a lot on my mind and determine where these might be coming from has there been ongoing rejection from peers from family if so why does this seem to be happening  isolation is often a protective measure that one implements to avoid further pain where does that need to protect originate  are there unmet needs from childhood are there traumatic life events that have created a need to selfprotect as a defense mechanism we can feel alone even when in a crow of people or at a party  this has nothing in this case to do with being around people it has more to do with how we view ourselves  if there is a prevailing message or script that has been internalized that says you are worth nothing or you dont deserve the company of others then being around people will not alleviate the problem but only exacerbate it i would want to evaluate how one feels about themselves and what negative messages one has received and has repeated to oneself over time the developmental needs meeting strategy is a therapy aimed at addressing unmet childhood needs if there is specific trauma that is associated with socializing with people then emdr can be very helpful in desensitizing and reprocessing the trauma  looking at whether this individuals issue with emptiness is straight depression or whether it is depression as a result of unresolved anxiety is key to determining a treatment strategy

i have a lot on my mind but all i want to do is stay locked in my room and not socialize with anyone why do i feel so alone,there is a difference in someone agreeing to try something and agreeing to continue to do it have you ever been willing to try something and then decided you did not like it a type of food a sport a new restaurant a type of dance so this does not mean that things have changed between you it does mean that the two of you may need to spend some time to find out what you both like instead of looking at it as a rejection look at it as a challenge an adventure that the two of you can go on as explorers together some couples have even found it helpful to each write down ten things they would like the other person to try and then each person can pick three things from the other persons list to add into their life together when they chose to over the next few weeks

i am a single mother as a child i was molested by my mothers boyfriend i never knew my father i started having children at 18 right after high school after having children i completely lost myself and gave all of my focus on my children now my children are getting older but i still dont know myself ive had several attempts at relationships and they all fail i stopped caring about a lot after my childrens father left me i fell into a spiral and got depressed,what your are experience is normal for most women  we usually forget about self and totally focus on our children putting our personal wants and needs aside  so to answer your question of how do you get to know yourself i usually do a 6 session course with my client by having them answer questions such as the following in the first session  what do i love other than your children  what are my own needs and desires  what 3 things have i accomplished in my life that im most proud of  what are 5 strengths or qualities i have  what is one event that had a major impact on my life  how have that event affected my life today  for their homework assignment after the 1st session they are asked to write a letter to self tell self what they love cherish appreciate and even admire about themselves  most women feel awkward at first but i remind them that the truth is that only to the extent that you are able to love and value yourself you are to love and support others
i always see the worst end of things my boyfriend and i arent talking and i swear hes leaving me i keep failing my road test and i see my future crumble i have no desire for friends i pushed my best friend away after christmas and i have no desire to fix it or make new friends my aunt died and i cry all the time even if i burn my lunch,i really love that youre taking responsibility for your pessimism here theres a modern parable about two young brothers one child is in a room full of every toy you could imagine and hes miserable the other is in a room full of horse manure and hes flinging it around with joy so then someone comes and asks the first boy why hes so miserable because he has so much he says that hes missing the one toy that he really wants then the brother is asked why hes so happy in a room full of manure and he says with all this sht theres gotta be a pony in here somewherehappiness is a state of mind and i hear you saying that you used to be happy so maybe this means you believe its possible thats a wonderful startresearch on depression shows us that it is very linked to pessimism you say i always see the worst end of things thats pessimism life is like an elephant if all you see is roughness backup and walk around the view will change the key to optimism is to build your ability to see the bad things in life as 1 temporary this will pass i know how to fix friendships 2 specific not involving the whole of your life and 3 not your fault tons of people fail road tests on the flip side it helps if we can see good things as 1 more permanent 2 bleeding into other areas of our lives and 3 something you created not taking credit for good things and blaming yourself for the bad ones is typical especially of women the feelings you are having are temporary youre in a slump and its a good time to sit down and look at how you can make the picture look different i think you know how but you lack energy right now if tackling this on your own isnt enough a therapist can help you take that step back to look at the big picture and help you rebuild your natural resilience and capacity for joy i wish you the best
i was anxious to go to middle school i was afraid of what people might say about me so when school started i wasnt acting like myself i was quiet which im usually not i didnt talk to anybody and didnt have any friends then a few years later my grandma died i really became depressed and stop going to school for a little i hated myself and still do i just need help i need someone to care for me i need someone to show that they care,i agree you need more care and support no one deserves to feel alone or like they hate themselves were all wonderful imperfect complicated people and were at our best when were all helping each other im glad you wrote this question because a lot of people have this feeling sometimes i can tell that youre smart because you seem to sense that the two things you wrote about are connectedyou not being yourself and then how you felt when your grandma died when grandma died you needed and deserved extra love and support but the people around you didnt seem to give it to you maybe my hunch is that they wanted to but that they didnt know how much you needed it or what you needed exactly the older you get the more you will have to take charge of letting people know what you need maybe this is one of the suckier parts of being mature but thats how it works when you started middle school it sounds like you changed you got more quiet right that must have felt weird to not be acting like yourself it sounds like fear tricked you into thinking people wouldnt like you fear can be silly so then fear got you to not show yourself and when we dont show ourselves people cant see who we are they dont know us as well and then they dont know what we need and they cant care for us as well either fear of not being liked isolated you from the people who love you it does that to a lot of us so where youre at right now is because of what fear did to you and also because when grandma died you were already isolated so people couldnt see your pain and know that you needed support theres a simple solution but youd have to be brave enough to look fear in the face and say get off my back youre not helping me by telling me lies can you be brave enough to go back to your old louder self if you talk to the people closest to youtell them what you think and how you feel then theyll be able to give you the care that you want and deserve i wish you well as you try this
i was in a situation with a guy hes my brothers friend and kind of like a brother to me he invited me over to hang out and then came on to me i was instantly terrified to say no and i gave in i dont know whats wrong with me i cant figure out why im afraid to say no this is giving me a lot of guilt and depression,hi tennessee there is nothing wrong with you there are many good reasons why you didnt say no you didnt say no because you were caught off guard and unprepared there is no place in life that teaches girls or boys how to manage it when someone crashes a sexual boundary you also live in a culture where girls are encouraged to be cooperative and not upset people and to put the needs of other people first you instinctively want people to like you and people can be very coercive sexually you said it yourself you gave in he wore you downtheres nothing wrong with you it wasnt your job to say no women arent the gatekeepers of male sexual urges it was his job to get your consent first he pressured you into it a good therapist would help you to dig deep and uncover all these barriers to saying no and more if you said no what might happen then what might that mean about you what are you avoiding feeling unloved unwanted cold what would you have to believe in order to be confident enough to say no that you didnt have to do anything you dont want to do that youre special or that sexuality is special would you need a better understanding of what sexual assault is i love that you want to do some work here to strengthen your sexual boundaries and i urge a widespread conversation about what consent it men and women of all ages could use more of this training
people have been calling me names and i have had enough of it i cannot stand it anymore im done i have told someone this and that is why i am writing this the thoughts are awful,its sounds like you are feeling pretty overwhelmed with intrusive thoughts and are feeling very criticized by others as well i think it is great that you are reaching out and i can tell that you want this to change working with a competent therapist may be a good option for getting some more clarity about what is going on developing ways to cope and eventually getting relief from these overwhelming experiences
my life is completely normal yet i feel empty inside i feel as if i already know why im alive to reproduce and die,are there any times or moments in which you feel other than empty  start with knowing the context of when you feel something other than emptyif there is no recent example then in your mind go back in time to think of when you felt something other than empty  recall what you liked about this time whether you were by yourself or with others what type of activity you were involved at the time of nonemptinesshow did you come to your conclusion that your life purpose is to reproduce and die  if this is what your parents siblings and extended family believe it is possible that you have a broader view of yourself and havent yet uncovered a way of defining your own philosophy of livinggive yourself the time to browse around online or in person social meet ups on your interests  it is possible you will discover entire new areas of life and ways of considering life that are brand new to you and which connect to your true selfthis is one way of respecting your individuality which of itself may decrease your sense of emptiness
im almost never happy half of the time i dont feel anything i find it easy to make myself feel nothing i know i push people away because its easier i just want answers im sick of feeling this way its ruining my relationships with people,maybe you have depressionthe name of your condition matters much less than the descriptions you wrote of how you feelsince youve observed how you sometimes interact with people and realize you arent happy with the result youve a very solid starting point for reflecting on your deeper wishes in relating to othersstart with asking reasons of yourself about the puzzling aspects of how youre engaging with otherstheorizing as to why you feel that pushing people away is easier and easier than whatgoogling the keywords of how you feel may open a starting point for ideas on knowing yourself and what you wish for
im almost never happy half of the time i dont feel anything i find it easy to make myself feel nothing i know i push people away because its easier i just want answers im sick of feeling this way its ruining my relationships with people,hi loyal this is a common question i suggest that you not diagnose yourself only a physician can do that but the symptoms you mention are certainly common signs of depression rarely happy emotional numbness hopelessness isolation depression is very common research suggests that one in three people may experience it in their lifetime and at any one point ten percent of adults may be experiencing it  most therapists are very good at spotting the signs and treating accordingly although only a physician can prescribe medicationthe great news is that depression is treatable some people experiencing depression may benefit from medication often to lift the heaviness of the illness enough so that one can focus on psychotherapy and therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy and behavioural activation therapy have demonstrated a clear ability to reduce symptoms of depression even if medication helps seeing a therapist to look at the roots of your depression and to build coping skills is very important a qualified therapist will help you look at the barriers to happiness in your specific case and suggest a course of treatment you are not alone and you dont have to suffer keep asking questions and you will find your answers
my husband and i are in a terrible place part of me wants to fix it but then im caught up with not knowing how and not being able to communicate my feelings to him because he always feels im blaming him sometimes i am because the feelings of distrust are so strong i feel they must be coming from something hes doing but sometimes i know im being irrational still that doesnt stop the anxiety the other half of the time i just want to walk away but i feel like that will only be a temporary fix,you may be pressuring yourself to be the one person who fixes the relationship  this is impossible because the relationship belongs to both of youhas he told you whether he feels about himself that how he interacts with you is contributing to problems in the coupleis he willing to understand what youre asking of him without shutting down with whatever he is feeling when he feels blamedyour feelings of distrust are the natural outcome of not being properly heard and understood  hes not willing to listen to you so of course youre frustrated and this frustration comes out in all sorts of uneasy feelingswillingness to hear each other in a nondefensive way sometimes requires a couples therapists assistanceask your husband if hes willing to understand not judge you  be willing yourself to do the sameif after trying and getting nowhere youll know when to stop trying on your own as a couple and to find a specifically trained couples therapistswarning not all therapists are trained to do couples therapy  ask the therapist if theyve had specialized training in couples therapyotherwise having a referee type therapy session of what do you think what do you think isnt going to do anything except frustrate both of you furthergood luck
they dont go away and i feel like im going crazy does that ever stop can it be a symptom of medication,since you realize that hearing voices in your head is not usual for you then definitely there is a problematic situation happening within your awareness of who you areif you recently started taking a new drug or increased dosage of one you already were taking and the voices started shortly after then yes it is possible medication created your problemstart by telling whoever gave you the presecription about the problem youre havingcrazy has some flexibility as to whether someone is this way or notcertainly a very positive sign that youre not crazy is that youre selfaware of a problem within yourself and youre responsible toward yourself and making effort to address this problemcrazy people usually dont do responsible behaviors
they dont go away and i feel like im going crazy does that ever stop can it be a symptom of medication,this can certainly be a side effect of some medications if the voices are so powerful that you can not sleep or they are constantly present you shouldnt wait any time but go and see your doctor straight away
a girl and i were madly in love we dated for over a year and were even talking about marriage and future plans together she moved away for school and we attempted a long distance relationship we eventually broke up its been a year now and i still havent lost my feelings for her i still love her the same way i did ive suffered from depression ever since the breakup and have been unable to connect with anyone else its damaging me and my life,hi boise im sorry that youve lost this love the fact that you were planning marriage and a future tells me that you meant something very special to each other at that time its different nowyoure not together anymore but you cant accept this right good for you for identifying that this situation is damaging your life youve been grieving for longer than you were together oh but really youve not been grievingyoure stuck still loving her instead of moving forward unrequited love is a recipe for eternal heartache lets look at some possible blocks to moving forwardit could be that theres something unfinished for you maybe you felt hurt and you didnt have the chance to say so or you felt you hurt her and you didnt have the chance to make it right maybe theres a burning question you need to ask or something else you need to say maybe you want to tell her youve never stopped loving her and see if she feels the same way if this is the case you have two choices right you can reach out and say what you need to say or you can stop ruminating on that question and let it go if you reach out theres no guarantee it will go well or that shell even respond maybe write her a letter and dont send it or send itit might be worth the risk use the next paragraph to help you decide do you know how she feels how did it end did she end it was it ended just because of the distance or are there more differences between you that didnt work sometimes people are so in love that they cant clearly see that the other person isnt in love with them anymore use the information you have about what she wants for her lifecan you honour what she says she needs if shes asked for distance you would do well to honour thata key to moving forward look at your thoughts and where theyre getting stuck write it down what bad thing can happen if you let it go or if i move forward that will mean  keep goingwhat would be the worst part of that  this kind of exploring can help you identify your stuck placeit is possible that youve turned this ending into some kind of negative meaning about you or your future as in if this person doesnt love me then im unlovable or no one will ever love me as much as she did so your need to cling to her in your heart is your way of rejecting that negative message about yourself or the future can you find another way to reject that message try saying these things to yourselfi know she loved me there is evidence of thati was a good partner there is evidence of thatits part of life to fall in love and then have to move forwardi can do this and learn from itmany people like methats how i know im lovableits normal to feel sad im grieving a lost lovei want to move forward and not stare in the rearview mirrori know more love awaits me if i can get fear out of the wayif this person loved me others can too but not if im clinging to some old memorythese are the kinds of things a therapist would explore with you i wish you well
ive got so much anger i dont know how to control myself my girlfriend screams at me all the time and sometime i dont know how to deal with life im very depressed and angry i feel lost,hi campbell river you say you have anger but you dont mention how it shows or maybe it doesnt are you aggressive with your girlfriend since you mention depression i wonder if youre bottling it all up somewhere instead of letting it show at all if this is the case i admire your ability to not lash out at someone whos hurting you however if they are totally  unexpressed anger turn inward and shift into depression when she yells at you what do you do is this the moment that you feel the most angry i wouldnt be surprised anger is a normal response to someone yelling at you something about angerits often there to cover up our more vulnerable emotions under the anger i wonder if you feel worthless powerless scared unloved part of the trick to reducing anger is identifying those other emotions and expressing them you say you dont know how to deal with life and i think maybe you mean you dont know how to deal with emotions lots of people dont this is confusing for most of us what am i feeling why is it so strong im afraid to express it for fear of hurting someone or falling apart or feeling alone how do i know what to express and what to be quiet about these are all great questions to ask yourself and a qualified therapist can help you sort it all out and support you in your growth i wish you well
ive been having this ongoing problem for most of my life now i am a young adult and right now driving and even being a passenger gives me terrible panic attacks and anxiety i cant ride in the backseat or the front seat with the safety belt on i have to lean the seat back a bit because the pressure on my back terrifies me i miss so many opportunities to go places with friends and family because of my fears of having a panic attack my family offers little to no support they think its fake or all in my head it makes me feel guilty and at times depressed to the point where id rather never wake up anymore i am not selfharming i just feel meaningless this constant fear has taken over my thoughts and my life i was such a happy person i want my life back i want to travel with my friends and family again but i dont know how ive almost given up hope on getting better and just accepting the fact that ill live with this anxiety forever,not having support from your family for such a significant problem is a problem itselfhow about your friends are any of them nurturing or treat you kindly when you bring up that youve got this problemare any of your friends willing to accommodate the fact that right now youve got panic attacks from driving and being a passengermaybe being and feeling accepted while youre in this current phase of your life would help diminish the panic attacksif no support is coming to you then a next step would be to evaluate the relationships in your life and to develop standards and expectations of others especially that they are considerate of your great need at this timeits possible you are bearing the emotional burden of a lot more people in your life than yourselfif no one wants to show they care about this situation then release yourself from trying to please and satisfy everyones wish that you be better while they ignore your need for their supportbe realistic in what youre able to give back to people who want to be blind to your emotional needthinking this way will at first raise your anxiety level from fear of losing everyone  eventually youll stabilize within yourself and know that all youre asking for is some support for having a tough time hopefully the others will be more responsive to youif they dont you still know that youre being reasonable for what youd like
i am broke but i am sure i have been depressed for the past couple of years i have always had anxiety i just need someone to talk to right now i dont have any friends or family i can talk to im on the verge of just giving up,good question there are resources out there  people to talk to id try going to this link and calling the free 247 hotline httpwwwsuicidepreventionlifelineorg
i dont know how to have emotions i never had any from my birth being human i think of myself as a monster i enjoy pain i cut myself for my climax during sex i think most of the time i lie even when sometimes it would have been easy just to tell the truth i was in rehabilitation for four year i have made love with both men and women but it made no impact in my emotions the books that i enjoy reading hp lovecraft and edgar allen poe i go hunting every saturday i feel powerful i dont enjoy the killing of the creature but the hunt of it and to eat and drink the flesh and blood of the creature,im not sure that you dont feel emotion or that you are frightened of the depth of your emotions from what you write the context of your growing up years had people telling you to not feel  little kids and babies dont remember whether or not they had emotions since birth  this is information someone told you or was part of your family systempossibly your family was afraid of their emotions or of you knowing yourssimilarly your comparison of being human means being monster like is not an obvious connection  besides monsters are an idea they arent real  they embody what someone considers the worst qualities of themselves or the human species  again i wonder whether youve taken on stories you heard growing up about how unacceptable and bad you area way to start learning your emotions is to start in simple basic ways to ask yourself what you are feeling in the situations that you believe emotions would belongif on the first bright sunny and warm day of the year you remind yourself to notice what youre feeling in response to this youll be taking one step toward awareness of your emotionsif someone buys you a birthday present be aware of how you feel  keep adding awareness to situations and see if this builds an ease with feeling emotions
i am on my own with my daughter i am so worried and stressed about her,your instinct to help your daughter is naturalhow you proceed depends a lot on whether she recognizes she has a psychological and emotional problem or if only you see this from observing heralso her age matters a lot in what way would be most likely to succeed in addressing the problems you describeif you and your daughter have different opinions as to whether or not she has problems and she is above the legal age of when you have authority over her life then you can only suggest to her that therapy may benefit herif your daughter is in your legal control then you can locate a counselor nearby discuss your situation with that person and depending on the outcome youd be within your parenting right to take your daughter to a counselorstarting therapy without willingness to do so is risky  the person may feel resentful enough to not participate  and sometimes the counselor is skillful enough to find a path to your daughter or any patients selfinterest and engage them in therapyfamily counseling regardless of your daughters age is another way to bring your concerns to your daughters attention in a therapy environment in which a counselor would be able to help distinguish the seriousness of your daughters psychological problem from simply a difference in viewpoints between you and your daughter in how to handle certain situationsalso if you believe your daughter is a threat to herself then instead of this slower route get in touch with the emergency psychological assessment service in your town for a more immediate response

i have experienced cycles of depression for the past four years and it hits me harder every time it comes back this past time it was extremely debilitating so i went on wellbutrin i could feel the effects of the medicine after the first week a month and a half later i decided that my depression was being caused by my own unwillingness to move forward and address my behaviors and thoughts that were keeping me in a place of despair i became worried that the medicine was making me complacent and prohibiting me from working out what i needed to in my life to bring back true fulfillment i stopped taking it a month ago and feel okay a lot of the anxiety it was paired with has gone away however i still dont feel my sense of self has been completely regained and i have days where i feel a zombielike haze of having no interests or the ability to fully concentrate on anything is it better to continue letting time and good habits work out the remaining depression or should i go back on the medicine,deciding whether or not psychiatric medicine is a good option can be complicated as you have noticed and only a person who is licensed to prescribe can give you medical advice regarding medications while there is sometimes relief from symptoms from medication as you have pointed out there are often negative side effects as well while i cant give you advice on whether or not to continue medication i would urge you to take an inventory of the positive and negative effects that you have noticed and educate yourself as much as possible about the short and longterm costs and benefits of psychiatric medication if you can find a doctor psychiatrist or arnp who is competent in mental health it may also benefit you to consult with themone thing that i am wondering about is what is your support system like in regards to your fight against depression are you seeing a therapist or attending any therapeutic or supportive group while there are many things that one can do on their own to work through challenges such as depression psychotherapy has been shown time and again in research to be highly effective and sometimes having a relationship with a caring competent professional who understands depression and ways of helping can make a huge difference
at school it feels like ive lost all my friends and ive been really weird with my sleeping patterns i used to cut myself and i really want to again but i change in the locker rooms because i dont want anybody to see i get ticked off easy and overreact at night im very depressed and listen to sad music and all that sort of stuff please help me i just want to be happy again and i feel like im starting to fake a smile at school,as silly as it may sound making sure that we are getting the right amount of restful sleep is very important when we are feeling low  the reason for this is the lack of proper sleep significantly affects our ability to problem solve and critically evaluate our situation and can lead to a domino effect in our thinking  i know you feel that you may be losing your friendships but what are the facts that have led to this belief really ask yourself are they facts or are they your perspective on events  in regards to your coping behaviours at night it sounds very isolating and also very silenced  as opposed to the sad music why not try all music allowing yourself to experience the wide breadth of emotions that are circling within you  one of the other recommendations i would make would be to try and journal about some of those thoughts and fears in order to release them in a positively cathartic way some of the behaviours that you have mentioned are a bit more significant though and i would recommend speaking with someone directly in the near future
i think about death all the time because i feel so alone i want someone to love and someone to love me,feeling alone andor isolated is almost always associated with being depressed as humans we need connection and interaction with others in order to feel satisfied given that you are frequently thinking about death i highly recommend that you see a mental health professional as soon as possible to help assess your immediate needs and address any underlying issues that may be contributing to your feelings of loneliness and depression the good news is that with proper consistent treatment and commitment to change things can really turn around for you a therapist can work with you on building enjoyable activities into your daily routine change maladaptive thought patterns that contribute to your sadness and help with exploring what has gotten you to where you are by learning about where your sadness originates engaging in preferred activities and changing your thought patterns you should begin feeling relief from the burden of depression what will likely result is further opportunity to find social outlets and an increased ability to connect with others dont give up create some short terms goals that you can likely achieve and make your treatment a priority and a focus you have already taken the first step in getting better by writing to this site keep on this path and believe in yourself best of luck to you

my fiancãe suffers from severe anxiety and depression she has had it most of her life her anxiety in public places is the worst it gets to points where she cant breathe or move sometimes she wont even go to the restroom so she will hold in her pee until her stomach hurts or she pees herself she curls up in corners at the mall and has panic attacks she wont eat or drink in public if she isnt having a panic attack or crying shes clinging to me and avoiding everything and everyone her depression flares up out of nowhere and causes her to become very suicidal and selfharming she get really sick from anxiety and scared to the point that i cant even get her to eat drink leave the bed or go outside she always tells me how she grew up around so much fighting and fear that it makes her scared of loud sounds yelling conflict and even talking to strangers in public she will refuse to go to a store unless i am with her to talk to the cashier for her she is so scared that i cant even get her to drive she doesnt want to get her license because shes scared of trying to drive some people have recommended medication but i believe its just going to cover up her illness and not solve it i dont want my fiancãe pumped with drugs i believe a psychiatric service dog would be the best bet for her when we first met my poodle it would calm her down a lot she took the dog out every time we went out and she seemed much calmer and happier she slowly would eat and the dog seemed to make her feel a lot better i am worried and want to help her without medication,it sounds like you have been a positive support for your fiancee there is no doubt that this situation is a great challenge for the both of you while it may feel like you are responsible for her health and happiness it is important that you understand that you on your own wont be able to resolve her mental health issues based on what you have explained it sounds like she needs to get a medical andor psychiatric evaluation whether or not she decides to take medication is her and your decision but keeping an open mind about treatment options is important i suggest that she see a therapist on her own in order to better understand and cope with her anxiety and depression especially given her suicidal thoughts you would also likely benefit from therapy individual or couples therapy in order to address how you are feeling and best learn how to support her and your relationship i wish the very best for both of you and hope that things will improve sooner than later

im supposed to stay here the rest of my academic life but ive never liked it here not even before i came ive never felt like i belong ive missed my country every second in the past four months and im just miserable im gaining weight doing nothing and crying for hours straight is it time to go back home or is it just culture shock,it sounds like you are feeling very unsure and out of place and the prospect of continuing to feel as you do now for the remainder of schooling seems daunting without getting to know more about you and your experiences here and at home it is hard to say what you should do however i think exploring these things with a competent therapist may help you to discover the answer
i am in high school and have been facing anxiety issues lately whenever i get close to being in a relationship some kind of anxiety takes over and keeps me from the relationship this anxiety causes me depression at times and even makes me want to vomit while a semirelationship should be joyous for me its an emotional nightmare i cant get to the bottom of ive had this before and had to leave the semirelationship to avoid throwing up every time i made contact with my crush what could be the reason behind this is it massive nerve problems is it a fear of a bad relationship while im not quite ready to be in one anyway i want to get to the bottom of this for a brighter future in which i can be in one i dont take medications and have no desire to i have read forums and ive talked about the issue with my sister who has faced similar problems,hi helenai felt a bit sad when i read this this is a new term for me semirelationship what does it mean i know that todays culture for young people is more of a hookup culture than a dating one maybe that means that you develop connections to people but you keep yourself from hoping for a full relationship because no one is doing that anymore that makes me feel sad i hear a lot of young women im not sure youre female but thats my guess say that they struggle with hookups because they cant let themselves hope for a phone call after a hookup research tells us that after a hookup college age women tend to feel used and unworthy and men tend to feel guilty i think this scenario works better for men than women but many of both genders are left unsatisfied in the endthis is only one possible explanation for your anxietythat your gut knows that it wants to feel fully coupled with someone but you struggle with whether its okay to want or expect thatmaybe take a moment and listen to anxiety anxiety tends to try to convince us that somethings wrong with us or something bads going to happen anxiety sometimes prefers to stay vague its more difficult to refute it then but you can try to clarify its whisperings by asking yourself these questions what am i afraid of what is the worst thing that might happen here then what might happen and what would be the worst part of that keep going until you find the very worst thing that might happen might someone not want youmight you feel rejectedor feel not good enoughyou might get hurtthen when you find that core fear you can look at your life and i bet youd find a place where that idea or fear originated a big moment or many smaller ones when you actually did feel or get rejected or abandoned or hurt in the end its a feeling youre trying to avoid not life or relationship and anxiety is trying to help you avoid it by making you overcautious but this doesnt work for you good with the help of a qualified therapist you can learn to talk back to anxiety and move forward in life and love with calm confidence
i just got out of a two year relationship i broke up with my boyfriend because he wasnt showing any affection at all he was talking to other women and lying about it it pushed me away and hurt me but im still in love with him a couple days after our breakup he was talking to someone new he told me he wasnt sure if he loved me i cried for several days lost my appetite and couldnt sleep our whole relationship was only us we didnt have friends it was me and him against the world we didnt talk to anyone else because we only wanted to talk to each other we hung out constantly and skyped to sleep every single night then when i cut myself we talked on skype he cried and told me im still in love with you i never stopped loving you and i cried tears of joy i asked multiple times if he loved me and asked to make sure he wasnt just saying that because of me being so depressed he promised and assured me he loved me he came over after that and we had sex because he wanted to he went the home that night and told me he didnt love me and he lied because he was scared he told me i wasnt attractive i wasnt beautiful to him and that i changed he also told me he was 100 sure hed never love me again im still in love with him why do i love him how do i stop just knowing that someone else is with him hurts me that i wasnt good enough and that im no longer beautiful hurts me i think i need a therapist but dont know if i should,i am very sorry for the pain you are suffering losing the most significant person in your life is extremely painful and breakups are often equated to a death there will certainly be a grieving process that you go through and time passing will allow the hurt to subside with that being said seeing a therapist is highly recommended as it sounds like continuous support may be necessary for healing to take place anytime sadness causes thoughts of suicide or self harm it is important to get help immediately a therapist can help you by validating your feelings and what you are going through while also working with you to move through the grieving process adopt new hobbies social outlets and goals for your future while starting over and trying out new ways of being may seem like a daunting task it will only make things easier and give you a sense of hope and purpose for your future with the new year right around the corner this could be viewed as a good time and opportunity to get reaquainted with yourself and set goals related to living a more fullfilling life hang in there with a support system in place and a healthy mindset things can only get easier best of luck to you
a friend of mine taking psychology advised i go to my doctor to check if i have major depressive disorder im afraid of the consequences of doing so if i do become diagnosed with major depressive disorder wont that go on my records i will never be able to become a counselor along with a list of other things i may be prohibited from im also afraid of taking any antidepressants this year my doctor gave me some for a dislocated hip i had a severe reaction and passed out moments after taking them everyone i know who has taken antidepressants says its a bad idea all around and youre better getting treatment without them im concerned they might take me to a clinic and force me to take medication because i am unable to make decisions on my own im not really suicidal but i am not really taking care of myself either someone also told me they still use electroshock therapy im not keen on that im wondering if i am better off just getting selfhelp and working things out on my own its just that ive been an emotional mess since i was in elementary school ive graduated now and tried to stay positive and be happy but i cannot deny i still am not good,i admire your courage for stating your view about antidepressants  questioning mainstream thinking and being in touch with your own views are signs of strength and clarity in a personas a therapist i always tell my patients to avoid antidepressantstheir effectiveness is in suppressing a persons mood and feelings  if someone does not know how they are feeling then they will have more difficulty in understanding themselves their uncertainties and hesitations and overall how they relate to others and what they expect from othersantidepressants mask how someone feelsin a crisis temporarily taking antidepressants may be helpful  if someone is so overwhelmed that they are not functioning then  suppressing unhappy feelings so that the person can get through a day may be of benefit for a short whilebasically respect and follow your own opinion about antidepressants  your view is shared by many  it is a minority opinion and very valid if you would like to shop for a therapist ask the person on the phone what their opinions are about antidepressantsideally you will eventually find a therapist who thinks in a way which is similar to you or at least similar enough that you will have a sense that you are able to trust working with them on whatever you define as problematici hope you will have an easy and productive therapist search

ive been hospitalized twice once was last month for psychiatric help im on medicine but im struggling with fighting the negative thoughts irrational fears and loneliness the people around me arent helping much,if you are someone who usually has a job pays or contributes to household bills and generally manages your own daily life then here are some suggestionsstart with small changes in your life so that you will feel successful in developing little areas of personal happinesssince the people whom you currently are in your life arent helping much consider branching out your life so that you are with those with whom you do feel help youfollow your natural interests  if you like reading look online for a local book club  if you like watching birds look up a bird watching groupsocial isolation increases the intensity of negative feelingsalso the way healthcare is set up in the us psychiatrists spend 15 minutes asking a person questions and then giving them a pill script   there is almost no human interest in the personif youd like feeling better as a person then find people  relying only on our mental health system will keep you feeling low and unsteadyif your life is a little more sheltered and you are in a group home setting or your basic needs are taken care of by someone or some organization then similar advice is still validfind and participate in whatever human settings which appeal to you and are available on a somewhat regular basis

my last relationships have ended horribly they just up and abandoned me one of them i have never gotten closure with over it leaving me emotionally wrecked i know somethings wrong with me but i dont know how to even start trying to better myself i get into these depressed like states whenever anyone i care about is too busy to be with me i know that i shouldnt act like that because people are genuinely busy but i feel like theyre doing it just because they dont want to be around me,frequently when working with clients i utilize the abc model developed by albert ellis the founder of rational emotive behavior theory the theory basically states that you can not control an event but you can control your reaction to the emotions associated with said event for instance here is an examplea action or event you need to talk to someone and that person is not calling you backb behavior or response you begin to tell yourself that this person is too busy for me or i am not important to this personc consequence you feel depressedif you look at the model b has a direct effect on c the thought is if you change your reaction to a then c will have a better consequence such asa stays the sameb this is what you change this person must be busy they will call me back when they get a chance or i can call someone else to lean on for support until this person is availablec decreased feelings of depression  overall functioning improvesthis is just an example but if you actively work to replace the negative thought patterns that effect your behavior studies show that your overall outlook and mood will improve if this model resonates with you i recommend feeling better getting better staying better by alber ellis in addition looking for support groups in your area are a great source of support when you are feeling abandoned or alone
i dont know whats wrong with me at times i can be really happy excited ill talk fast and i want to do things but lately ive been staying up way later and sleeping too much i dont hang out with friends i dont really have them i feel nothing worthless i want to do nothing i have no interest in anything all i usually do is stay in my room i want to be happy i want to be nice whats wrong with me,im sorry to hear that you are feeling as if youre in a slump first of all nothing is wrong with you many people report similar symptoms have you ever talked with a physician regarding your symptoms two extreme emotions such as feeling extremely happy and then feeling extremely low for a length of time may indicate a mood disorder i think it would be best to talk with your doctor or a therapist to help pinpoint the issue causing themits possible that it could just be certain stressors in your life that are causing the two extremities but you definitely want to rule out any mental health issues if it is in fact mental health related there are many medications or therapy choices that can help thanks for reaching out i hope that you will feel back on track soon
ive have lived for sometime with depression but things have gotten a lot better but why is it so hard to get over anxiety and social isolation,the best way to handle depression and anxiety is with a combination of appropriate medication given to you by a medical doctor and therapy to help you understand the thoughts feelings and behaviors that are causing the depression and anxiety in the first place and then to replace these with more positive thoughts and behaviors this is not something that anyone should just œwhite knuckle and try to get through on their own with no help cognitive behavioral therapy is a technique that has been proven helpful for depression and anxiety this takes a therapist trained in cbt there are some things in life that you cannot change and must learn to accept a lot of people spend time trying to change things that they have no control over this may be the behavior of someone else in your life or it could be a situation that you cannot change such as the recent death of a loved one a lost relationship or an accident or illness which has left you handicapped in cases like this what can change is your attitude and thoughts about the situation that you now find yourself in one thing that is inevitable about life is that stuff happens and it is not always pleasant some people take these unpleasant occurrences very hard and it throws them into a deep depression other people seem to be able to handle lifes ups and downs and bounce back they do this with having positive coping skills in their life learning new coping skills is something your therapist can help you witha lot of people are so focused on trying to change the things in their life that they cannot change and are ignoring the things that they can change there are things that you can do here is a quote for you to consider œyou are getting almost everything that you are getting based on the choices that you have made you will continue to get the same thing out of life until you make some changes another quote i like is œyou will find a way or you will find an excuse dont ever say that you have no choice everyone has a choice you might not particularly like any of the choices that you are facing but you do have choices not happy in a relationship you can leave it hate your job get a new one if it matters to you you will find a way dont sit there complaining about everything but not doing anything different or bettertake care of yourself exercise is very important not only for your physical health but for your mental health as well eating right and exercising will help you feel better about yourself also find a meditation that works for you there are progressive muscle relaxation exercises visual and mental meditations and many many more start making some positive changes in your life today you can do it
im in a state of depression right now who can i talk to ive been sick in a lot of pain and crying dont know where to turn,first of all if youre sick and in pain have you seen your doctor if you have a chronic illness and pain this can often lead to depression and is very common youve taken the first step to dealing with it you can talk to your doctor even if your depression isnt related to your health he or she can either look at prescribing you an antidepressant or can refer you to a psychologist or psychiatristif thats not really an option for you there are also helplines local or national or support groups where people dealing with similar issues can talk to each other if you cant find any in your area newspapers usually publish this information there are online support groups as well
ive been married for 3 years and i have two kids during my 3years married my husband cheated on me twice the second time really got to me and at my lowest i hurt him back we arent communicating as well as i would like what do i do,hi there thank you reaching out for help it takes a lot of courage for someone that is being abused to reach out for help i want you to know that i am here to help you in any way that i can first and foremost you did not mention whether or not you had children yourself by this man im going to assume there are so the most important thing right at this moment is asking yourself if you and your children are safe is the boyfriend currently living in the home or is he coming and going if he is coming and going or currently living in the home my suggestion for you to is to pack a bag for you and your children and go somewhere safe ie family members home friend or a shelter temporarily i cannot stress this enough although some people tend to minimize their abusers behavior ie they only do it when they are drinking they only do it when they are mad its those individuals that find themselves or their children in a serious situation so you can never take abuse physical or mental lightly because you never know what is going through that persons mind at that particular time its always better to be safe than sorry secondly it will not be safe helpful or productive to attempt to talk to the abuser about your relationship abusers often times try and manipulate you into staying by apologizing or attempting to justify their behaviors this is the time you would want to go see a magistrate in order to get a protective order for you and your childrenits unfortunate that your significant other was involved with another women causing pregnancy however that is no longer your concern your concern at this point is keeping yourself and your children safe i would also suggest counseling for you and your children in order to work through these issues i hope this was helpful and please stay safe and take care of yourself
when im in large crowds i get angry and i just cant deal with people i dont really like other people i prefer animals they make me nervous and scared i lay awake at night thinking and having conversations in my head and i almost always end up making myself feel terrible and crying i have more conversions in my head than i do with actual people i dont know whats wrong with me and why i feel this way what should i do,what you are experiencing is totally normal and these emotions mean you are human humans are social creatures who were created to be in connection with others but sometimes our life experiences or genetics can make that more difficult for some of us it is possible that these reactions are based on negative reactions you have had with others in the past maybe your family or other traumatic interactions with others it is also possible that they are caused by an underlying condition such as anxiety or depression which may cause you to be more uncomfortable around others or annoyed by others some people are also more bothered by crowded spaces loud interactions and the actions of others of course you prefer animals me too they provide unconditional love and support do not judge you and do not require you to have conversations with them the fact that you have conversations in your head at night tells me that although you say you do not like people you are craving some social connection what is probably the case is that you were never really taught how to interact and have those conversations the good news is that there is nothing wrong with you you just need a little help learning how to have these conversations and taking some healthy risks to initiate conversations and that is something that i help many of my clients with in therapy

sometimes i cant stop thinking about life after death i was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven when i think of living forever even if it is in heaven which should be good i feel overwhelmed i dont like the thought of living forever and ever and ever sometimes i just cant get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety am i crazy i dont think these thoughts are normal,you might be surprised how normal you are anxiety is incredibly common and while your particular type of existential anxiety might be unique to you  it is very difficult for most people to really comprehend what happens after we die  regardless of the religious or philosophical belief systems we hold it is the ultimate unknown and some philosophers and psychologists believe that at the root of our daytoday anxieties is the fear of death or fear of the unknown  just as it can be really hard to comprehend the ending of life it can also be hard to comprehend an eternal existence what these both have in common is that we are imaging a future that is ultimately unknowable and this unknown can provoke a lot of anxiety mindfulness based practices like meditation  maybe there is something like this in your religious tradition  can be very helpful in making peace with the unknown in the present moment the more we can learn to live in the moment  the less we get hung up on anticipating outcomes for our lives that may never come true mindfulness practices can help you ground be where you are  relax and regulate your nervous system so that you are able sleep and recuperate and train your attention to focus on living the life you want to live now  rather than worrying about what happens after you die having said all that  it can be profoundly helpful to speak with someone about your anxiety  especially when you feel haunted by it worry that you are crazy and cant get to sleep there are lots of good therapists out there who can help you with your anxiety

i get very nervous and anxiousscared before sex,tell your partner about this so that ideally the person has a chance to be supportive and reassuring as well as listen to your specific worries and fearsinitiate this type of discussion at a time which is removed from the time youre about to have sexthis way you and your partner both have a chance to realize the two of you are having a discussion  not a prelude to sexif you meant in your question that you feel anxious about having sex w a random partner then maybe you are less interested in hookup sex than you imagined
i get very nervous and anxiousscared before sex,i first wonder what your anxiety or fear connects to i dont know whether it is about sex itself or about ideas of worthiness or feeling desirablethere is also a difference between having selfdoubt about the actual physicality of having sex performancerelated or having doubts about whether you want to have sex with a particular personhaving sex can lead to feelings of great vulnerability if your partner is someone you trust consider discussing what it is that comes up for you around the issue of sex this is the certain things that your partner would be willing to do that and the ease your discomfort like staying with you for some time before and after sexual interactionsanother idea to consider is spending time with your partner and using nonsexual touch for each other perhaps first you to him and then him to you and communicating very clearly about what you like and do not like some people like to be spoken to during physical touch and other people do not all of this can be part of your discussions when you feel comfortable with that you could move into sexual touch in this manner and actually look at what you do and do not like you may also consider discussing things that are totally offlimits for you all the time and things for which you would like warning or awareness before they happen there are really a number of different ways to work on becoming more comfortable if you trust your partner and if your concern is about sex itselfif this feels pretty structured it is initially generally the idea is to learn more about each other and yourselves and then the process becomes much more naturalif the concern relates more to selfesteem related sex consider asking your partner to list several things that he or she likes about you even if you dont necessarily see yourself in the same light consider that this is how your partner sees you so these are some of the things that make you attractive to them perhaps both in sexual ways and in a wider discussion of the relationshipif this is difficult for you to sort out on your own consider seeing a therapist with experience working with couples or relationships

i have anxieties about everyday stressors ie finances work relationships kids and maintaining a household,something to remember about anxiety is that its a useful and necessary response to stressors and we all have a level of anxiety that falls somewhere on the spectrum from very slight to very overwhelming anxiety is our brains way of prompting us to deal with the stress in our lives by getting us geared up for action some helpful ways of managing anxiety are actually very simple the first id recommend is a calm breathing technique  breathe in for 45 seconds and then out for 78 seconds try to repeat this for 35 minutes another suggestion is to pay closer attention in the moments you feel the physical symptoms of anxiety and see if you can describe  without judging  the sensations to yourself try to be very specific such as my palms are feeling very sweaty and i can feel the slight tightness and fluttering in my belly of the butterflies then try to sit with these sensations without deciding if they are good or bad  just experiencing them as intentionally as possible  combining the calm breathing with this technique can also be very helpful if you feel that these techniques dont help and your anxiety about everyday stressors are inhibiting you from being able to engage in life the way you want to then id highly recommend going for an assessment or even just consultation with a professional this professional can help you determine if therapycounseling would be helpful for you to develop additional skills for managing those interfering anxiety symptoms

ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,hello first i am so sorry you are experiencing these feelings they can be intense i will do my best to offer some suggestions or thoughts that i hope will be helpful to you there could be a number of things occurring therapy is a delicate private decision and i would first like to commend you for the fact that you are not giving up that you are working to figure this out and make this work it sounds like you are engaged and motivated to receive support from a professional your continued  dedication and motivation will take you far i would first start by asking if you have discussed this with your therapist if you feel comfortable enough telling your therapist what is going on maybe inform the therapist that  that you feel nervous and shaky i am a firm believer in open communication between the client and therapist as this builds a healthy therapeutic relationship that yields positive outcomes if this can be obtained and well received this is your time for healing and therapy should be a safe supportive environment to not only process but to seek support and guidance from a professional who can help you move past the barriers if you feel you are comfortable and able to speak to your therapist that would be my first suggestion is to tell he or she how you are feeling if they know then they can help determine the potential cause and allow you to process and move forward if this is left un resolved it will be hard for you to move forward if you are not comfortable discussing this with your therapist this may be something to take into consideration and worthy of thinking about why you are not comfortable speaking to the therapist i understand this is difficult if i may offer one more suggestion breathing exercises are very beneficial remind yourself what you are working to achieve close your eyes in a safe moment and breathe in and out slowly in slowly through your nose and out through your mouth with pursed lips breathe in for approximately 510 seconds then let it out slowly be sure and do this when you are in private and feel safe environment when you begin i suggest putting your hand on your stomach over your belly button to feel yourself actually taking in those deep breaths i know it may sound kind of silly but they really work and are incredibly helpful we often forget to breathe especially when we are feeling anxious you are supported here and try taking yourself through the above thought process and breathing and practice the breathing several times a day i hope this shaky and uneasy feeling eases wishing you the very bestlaura cassity lmsw lmac
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,it can be uncomfortable talking to someone about your life in the great detail that is normally necessary for counseling to be beneficial since youre already going to counseling congratulations on taking that big first stressinducing step hopefully by now you are starting to feel a little more comfortable with your therapist it can be helpful to address this big elephant in the room and talk to your therapist about this i do my best to help people feel comfortable when they come to counseling but regardless of how hard we try sometimes it is just a little hard to get accustomed to the good news is the more you keep at it the more normal it will become
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,if you have only been to a couple of sessions it makes sense that you might still feel apprehensive at first therapy is hard work you may be talking about some things that you never talked to anyone about before opening up to stranger can be scary after you feel comfortable with your counselor and trust has built up and you feel understood in session you should feel more relaxed i would encourage you to talk to your counselor about feeling a little shaky sharing what the process is like for you is important in your work if you still feel unsure about sharing after several sessions it is important to take a look at that and try to understand where that may be coming from for example are you and the therapist not a good fit but again if you are just starting out in working together feeling a little bit nervous makes perfect sense and i encourage you to give it a bit more time and to talk to your therapist about how you are feeling
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,hi there thank you for your question its absolutely ok to feel nervous going to therapy i have experienced anxiety going to see my own therapist there can be a few reasons why you might feel this way first it is always unnerving to see a person who is a stranger and to share intimate things with that stranger you mentioned it has only been a couple of sessions your anxiety might subside as you continue to see your therapist and grow more comfortable with himher another reason why you might feel particularly nervous is perhaps you are not comfortable sharing things as children we might have bad experiences opening up to others someone might bully or ridicule us and that experience can stay with us for a long time making it extra scary to share our intimate feelings and thoughts with others if this the case as you continue with your sessions and have positive interactions with your therapists this anxiety will subside with time and you will relearn that it is safe to share and the last thought why you might feel the shakes is perhaps you know that you need to talk about some past experiences or memories that are uncomfortable and difficult regardless of the reason it might help you to bring up your nervousness in your session and share how you feel with your therapist having an open dialogue about your anxiety with your therapist can help you resolve some of that anxiety and built greater trust with your therapist
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,thank you for your question its completely normal and natural to feel nervous before a therapy session many people report having felt this way i cant say enough regarding the amount of courage it takes to reach out and attend a therapy session for many people it can take weeks months or even years of contemplating whether to see a therapist or not before actually contacting one and attending the first session it takes courage to want to work through any struggles you may be having or personal growth you aspire toward in your question you mentioned that youve gone several times and are still feeling nervous and shaky if you feel comfortable with your therapist and its a good fit for you i would suggest talking about this with your therapist you dont have to struggle each time you have your appointment together you and your therapist can work toward helping you have a different experience
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,sure why notits nervewracking to go to a man or woman youve never met before and who is a total stranger that you are paying to take an interest in your life youre likely feeling an internal truth about the sessions the man or woman with you and the man or woman sitting across from you id listen to those feelingswouldnt it not be best to go to those around you that do provide comfort and aid first wouldnt it be better to attend to those of faith around you who have love to offer first wouldnt it be better to go to your family and loved ones first might try that see if your nervousness evaporates
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,what you are experiencing is extremely normal opening up to someone you dont know from a can of paint can elicit some uncomfortable feelings and make you feel shaky with time and building trust with your therapist you will eventually start feeling less apprehensive before sessions consider bringing this up to your therapist as you both can process this experience together and figure out ways of coping with this anxiety before you come into the therapy room
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,its very normal to be nervous going into therapy you are being vulnerable and honest which is always scary no matter how many times you do it the best part about therapy is that the more you go the more confident you are in your ability to work through those difficult feelings and while you still may sometimes get nervous you will have confidence too
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,it depends on your definition of normal i would say that the average client i see feels some level of nervous energy when they come into their sessions and especially at the beginning i think that with clients who i work with that have difficult times in relationships maybe being able to trust people is tougher for them given their life experiences the expectation would be that they have a harder time moving through those nerves and feeling more at peace in sessionsin my opinion a competent therapist could help you explore where these nerves are actually coming from talking about yourself relating to another something else i encourage all of my clients to bring up whatever emotions are coming up for them in the moment as its helpful to the client to recognize the present moment emotion and then being able to process learn from and move through to a more peaceful place if that is what is being sought
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,therapy can feel very weird to begin with  think about it how often do we go and tell a relative stranger our deepest darkest thoughts in the rest of our life so i think its reasonable to expect a certain level of nerves as you get used to your therapist and to the whole process of talking about yourself and vulnerable topics that said its definitely worth bringing to the attention of your therapist if you havent already to see if there is anything that they can do or that the two of you can explore together that might make the process feel less intimidating to you
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,it takes a lot of courage to go to therapy i have gone myself as a counselor and know what that feeling is like this is normal but hopefully you have become more comfortable with your therapist this might be something to bring up to your therapist and openly discuss scary to do but its ok this may even relieve some of your anxiety if it continues you may want to consider trying another therapist as this one may not be the best fit for you
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,therapy does not work overnight oftentimes it is a lifelong struggle the therapists job is not to cure you or to remove something but rather to make you strong enough to live your life with your own peculiarities and struggles remember we are human and constantly fallible another important thing to note is that although you go to therapy that is just a room most of the magic and work takes place in your real life outside of that room
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,yes feeling nervous for the first few or several sessions of therapy is completely normaltherapy is an unusual way to have a conversation with someone  the person is an expert in recognizing and understanding dynamics of human interactions  for some people the fear is that the therapist knows more about you than you do yourselfin general terms hopefully your therapist has worked with many other people whove faced problems similar to yoursin this sense the therapist has a general idea of the basic dynamics you most likely are handlingno therapist could possibly know your particular details and your particular areas of upset or in what ways you feel unsure of yourselfonce you start to trust both your own right to tell your particular story and start to also feel that your therapist is listening attentively and cares what you tell the person your nervousness will start to disappear all on its owngood luck in getting the most from your therapy sessions
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,it is absolutely normal to be nervous about therapy  many people take years to make the decision to start counseling and although it is a safe place to explore feelings it may be the first time you are facing certain issues  it takes courage to face issues head on  being nervous is part of the process  the fact that you are continuing to go to therapy sessions despite feeling nervous demonstrates your strength  keep it up
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,yes it is completely normal to feel anxious about therapy therapy often explores topics and feelings that are uncomfortable the ultimate goal of therapy is to feel better but the process itself can be uncomfortable

ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,well its generally okay to feel anxious or nervous about going into therapy particularly in the beginning because the process of being open about what you are going through much less to someone who you dont know well can be anxietyproducing its also common to feel anxious when you are discussing something that is important difficult to discuss or you are making changes that are very difficult for youthe most important thing i can tell you though is to discuss with your therapist this idea that you feel nervous and shaky some anxiety can actually help to motivate or lead you toward change there are also level of anxiety that can be counterproductive so its a good thing to discuss personally i can tell you that i would want my clients to tell me about anxiety they feel 100 of the time that opens the dialog to discuss whether it is the level of anxiety that they want to sit with and learn about in discovering more about themselves and their experiences andor whether they would like to do something to lessen the feeling of anxietythanks for writing here if it caused anxiety for you to do so i hope that feeling is diminishing for you at least related to writing here

ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,its normal to feel a little anxietyafter all its an important encounter for you  my suggestion is to discuss this with your therapist let himher know how youre feeling especially if you feel as though your level of anxiety is impacting the quality and benefit of your sessions  you might try some relaxation techniques prior to starting the session deep breathing progressive relaxation core muscle disengagementif youre not familiar with these techniques ask your therapist or write back
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,hello there you ask about being nervous and shaky walking in to your therapy session and want to know if its normal  i realize there a few ways to look at this i presume you werent anticipating feeling this way and probably hoped to feel the opposite well my initial response is yes sure it can be within reason to feel this way have you been in therapy before is this somewhat new that could be part of the reason but either way new or not i think when are entering into a meeting that holds potential evaluation of deep things about you and your heart and soul it can cause anyone to tremble the soul can be anticipating some things could be shaken up here and it can feel scary to look at these things and then change looking deep at our life can feel daunting and scary so your response just might be regards to potential growth trying to happen  or is there something about the therapist you dont feel confident about this too might be in play as a reason for your feelings maybe you lack confidence in that therapist  have you let your therapist know how you feel that would be good to explorei would like to encourage you to look at these ideas hope it helps  let me knowkindlykeithkeithcounselingcom
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,normal can be an insidious word to use because it can undermine your sense of worth  it implies theres one particular way you should be behaving and can leave you feeling crappy and abnormal if youre not behaving according to that prescribed standard  instead what id recommend is to pay attention to your emotional experiences when youre attending therapy  explore your feelings and thoughts without judgement and try to reflect and understand whats going on thats causing you anxiety  once you figure out the underlying meaning of the anxiety you can figure out a way to handle it and action steps to take to diminish it
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,everyone has different experiences going to therapy being nervous can be a typical emotion one might feel emotions are our bodys way of telling us important information about ourselves i would suggest talking openly in your sessions about this that way you can process your thoughts and feelings with the guidance of your counselor there are probably underlining emotions fears or insecurities that are being stirred up during your therapy sessions your counselor might suggest individual counseling depending on what you learn about your anxiety in individual therapy you would have time to deal with your own stressors as you address your issues then you will have tools and skills that will be useful in addressing the couple relationship
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,i would be more concerned with how is this being addressed in therapy therapy can be a rewarding process however often times we do not pay much attention to the messages being sent to our bodies i believe in somatic therapy which deals with our mind  body connection i would think it may not be a question of normal or abnormal however if it is impacting you then you must pay attention to that it would be helpful to explore the feelings youre having  with your therapist it may be something that needs addressing to help alleviate those feelings or have a better understanding of why they are showing up when it is time for therapy
ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,it is totally normal  you have a lot riding on this and youre invested think about why you feel so shaky  is it something about the therapist or their style if so it would be a good idea to talk with them about it so you feel more at ease in any case bringing up your feelings about therapy in therapy is totally appropriate and even necessary good luck

when im around people i sometimes think someone has made a comment to me or asked me to do something i will be focusing on something else and then randomly think i hear something about me i never know if it was actually said,anxiety can absolutely make you think you heard something about you when we are on high alert we tend to look for threats and often the greatest threats we experience on a daily basis are social in nature to some extent this is normal for example when people experience late onset deafness they often will worry people are talking about them and usually not good things because our brains tend to jump to that of course im not saying you are going deaf or anything just giving an example counseling can help you work through this anxiety it may also be helpful to reach out to a counselor to rule out if there may be other things going on sometimes things like paranoia can blend in with anxiety which is a very distressing experience but both are absolutely treatable wishing you the best
when im around people i sometimes think someone has made a comment to me or asked me to do something i will be focusing on something else and then randomly think i hear something about me i never know if it was actually said,it sounds like you are having difficulty knowing if people are saying things to you or if you only thought someone was talking to you and this is anxiety producing its understandable that it could be confusing andor a bit scary to be unsure if people are speaking to you or not its hard to say exactly what is going on from just this description but if you can work with a competent therapist you may be able to get more insight into what is happening get clarity about your social interactions and develop some ways to deal with the anxiety

i have been with my boyfriend for more than a year he recently got a new job and travels a lot im not used to him being gone all the time i feel as though he has forgotten about me because he does not talk with me as much and doesnt keep me up to date on everything that he does throughout the day which he used to i feel lost sad and unwanted this is really a tough new challenge i just want to break up with him but i love him so much i dont know why he is acting this way lately i believe i have separation anxiety is there anything that i can do to help me cope with this while he is out of town,relationships at any amount of distance can be so hard it makes sense that you are encountering more anxiety than usual given that major change in your relationship and youre right that being separated from our partners can heighten our insecurities and worries about not only our relationship security but about our partners interest have you talked with your boyfriend about this struggle youre feeling it can be hard to have this kind of conversation without triggering a sense of blame and subsequent defensiveness in our partners but it really is possible if you have any concerns about being able to do this then a session or two with a local counselor or therapist might be really helpful  and it really can be just about finding the way to share what youre feelingas far as coping with anxiety there are a lot of options but i highly recommend an app called selfhelp for anxiety management theres so much good information in this app to help you learn to pay attention to what kinds of thoughts are helpful or unhelpful and there are also lots of activities for calming down and decreasing the intensity of that anxiety the best part is its free

i have been with my boyfriend for more than a year he recently got a new job and travels a lot im not used to him being gone all the time i feel as though he has forgotten about me because he does not talk with me as much and doesnt keep me up to date on everything that he does throughout the day which he used to i feel lost sad and unwanted this is really a tough new challenge i just want to break up with him but i love him so much i dont know why he is acting this way lately i believe i have separation anxiety is there anything that i can do to help me cope with this while he is out of town,consider talking with your boyfriend about times that you may be able to talk together while he is away this way you have an idea when youll be able to contact him does he recognize the feelings that you have while he is away how do you feel when you are together with him and he is homeim also curious as to how the level of your anxiety on a scale of 1 to 10 perhaps changes during the parts of his trips maybe there are certain parts that are more or less related to anxiety for you perhaps you have less anxiety while working or involved in a specific activity for example spending time with friendswhen you are both in the same area when your boyfriend is not traveling do you do some things independently with friends do you know what leads to your anxiety when he is away i dont know whether it is a general feeling of wanting him to come back or anxiety that something specific will happen to you or himdo you ever recall feeling this way in your past if so what was happening thenwhat do you have that makes you feel very safe and comfortableconsider working with a mental health professional in the area perhaps it would be helpful for the two of you to meet with a therapist who specializes in couples to see what kind of relationship you want to have and what you can each do to contribute to that relationship there could be things that you could both start or stop doing to help your relationship move in the direction where you would like it to go as an example perhaps you would like a text before your boyfriend goes to bed no matter what time zone or time of day it is perhaps he would prefer a good morning text or callvoicemail from you
i panicked over a minor parking lot mistake it was totally my fault but due to another insurance issue i left a note with an illegible phone number guilty over this i got an envelope containing several hundred dollars unfortunately by the time i returned the other driver had seen my ersatz note and drove away since i cannot make this up to that individual how do i atone for my cowardly act i have been trying to do random acts of kindness in hopes that karma will somehow even out,from your writing you have already atoned for what you describe as cowardlyrecognizing your action and trying to directly correct it realizing your action was improper and demonstrating the willingness to take right action are all examples of making things rightsince the actual driver is unavailable to consult as to their wishes on what they expect and feel would correct the matter you did the next best thing and considered the situation from the driver point of view

ive been having horrible anxiety for the last week i cant sleep i get a sense of doom and its hard to breathe i feel like nothing i do makes it better,anxiety is usually a sign of a current problem to which familiar emotional patterns of feeling similarly upset attach themselvestry to understand more about who you are what you like feel uneasy about especially your deeper emotions of being emotionally harmed or injured by meaningful peopleanxiety is best addressed indirectly by understanding and kindly accepting previous hurt and fears from long agoonce you feel at ease with dynamics of past situations then the current anxiety will decrease  this is because you will have adjusted and found new ways of handling otherwise frightening and overwhelming interactions and involvements with others
when i get talked to by my dad or stepmom or if im in trouble i will begin to cry and not say whats wrong with me when my dad or stepmom ask what is wrong i never know the answers or the words to put together what is actually wrong with me,maybe you need more time to reflect and organize your thoughtstry to figure out what would make you feel more relaxed about talking to your dad or stepmomalso its possible you simply dont feel safe around either of them and so intuitively realize youre better off not talking with them about a delicate matterdepending on whether you trust talking to dad and stepmom you may simply wish to excuse yourself from speaking about yourselftheres no good reason to be heartfelt with people whom you dont feel are willing to accept or understand who you are

i just took a job that requires me to travel far away from home my family and i really need this job people keep telling me i have anxiety and im terrified of having an anxiety attack on the road this is all new to me what can i do,anxiety often occurs when big or unexpected changes come to our lives like having new jobs relocating or assuming new roles notice if your anxiety feels like excitement concerns or fearit seems like you are excited about your new job but worried because others are telling you that you have anxiety  lets notice how others input is affecting your thoughts and maybe causing more anxiety that you may really have   if you are indeed experiencing anxiety that does not mean that you will have panic attacks  but if you are experiencing panic attacks or suffer them at some point you could learn how to reduce them either with therapy or medicationyou can learn how to process it depending what triggers it and channel it in a useful way for example you could plan a schedule around your new job and be meticulous about it because you are worried about how your new job may affect your routine or you could feel overwhelmed with your schedule focus on the feeling but not do anything about it notice the difference the key is in recognizing if you are anxious about something that you can change or have control over it and take action if you do and recognizing when you cannot control things and be ok with not being in controli teach clients how to use meditation and cognitive reframing techniques to help calm anxiety symptoms if you are interested in engaging in counseling or teletherapy you may contact me at 7874665478i wish you success on your new journeyestoy preocupada por mi nuevo trabajola gente me dice que tengo ansiedad y estoy aterrorizada de tener un ataque de pãnico en la carretera esto es nuevo par a mã que puedo hacerla ansiedad ocurre comãºnmente cuando llegan cambios grandes o inesperados en nuestras vidas como tener un nuevo empleo mudarse o asumir nuevos rolesal parecer estãs emocionada por tu nuevo trabajo pero preocupada por que otros te dicen que tienes ansiedad notemos como la opiniã³n de otros esta influenciando tus pensamientos y tal vez te puede estar causando mãs ansiedad de lo que realmente tienes si realmente estas pasando por un periodo de ansiedad no es necesario que vayas a experimentar ataques de pãnico pero si ya los haz experimentado puedes utilizar terapia o medicamentos para controlarlosnota si tu ansiedad se siente emocionante preocupada o temerosa puedes aprender a procesar estos sentimientos dependiendo que pensamiento los causen y canalizar la ansiedad de manera productiva por ejemplo te puedes enfocar en organizar una agenda porque te preocupa como tu nuevo empleo afectara tu rutina diaria o te puedes sentir agobio respecto a cã³mo tu trabajo afecta tu rutina y no hace nada mãs que preocuparte constantemente notas la diferencia la clave estã en saber cuãndo te preocupas  por algo que puedes cambiar y tomar acciã³n vs cuando te preocupas  por algo que no puedes cambiar y aceptar que no lo puedes cambiarle enseão a mis pacientes a usar tãcnicas de meditaciã³n y re enfoque cognitivo para manejar sãntomas de ansiedad y desorden de pãnico si te interesa una cita de consejerãa o teleterapia me puedes contactar al 7874665478 mucho ãxito en tu nueva jornada

i recently broke up with my boyfriend after being together for over 4 years i truly believe i did the right thing but omehow being single now has made me very needy and unsure of myself i am seeing someone casually and i am losing my mind with anxiety about how he feels about me and this need for validation how can i learn to be content and at peace with myself regardless of my career relationship status etc,hello what you are experiencing is entirely reasonable for someone that is still trying to adjust to a new life and also leave behind a long term relationship it sounds like you lost touch with who you were as a person and need to start exploring that side of you again spend time doing things that you have been putting off or did not do because you were involved take the time to become one with yourself before you get into another serious relationship regaining selfconfidence on yourself will help you with all other areas of life it is time to make you a priority and to start focusing on your mental and physical well being get connected with your community and find things you would want to do that give you purpose and lift you before too long you will be in your way to being content and in total control of your mind and at peace best of luck mirella
i recently broke up with my boyfriend after being together for over 4 years i truly believe i did the right thing but omehow being single now has made me very needy and unsure of myself i am seeing someone casually and i am losing my mind with anxiety about how he feels about me and this need for validation how can i learn to be content and at peace with myself regardless of my career relationship status etc,moving on from a long term relationship can be difficult  sometimes we can lose a sense of who we are because in a way we have become defined by the relationship itself  so when we begin to move on and see other people our sense of identity may be obscured  the tendency is to seek out validation to give us a feeling of worthiness  that its ok to move on and be happy  this is a relatively normal reaction  its important to treat yourself with kindness and compassion through this time in your life  mindful selfcompassion can be a great way to begin the process of getting that sense of who you are back and what you want in a relationship  i think its important to look back learn what you can from the previous relationship and become a better person for it in the future  at the same time taking the necessary time to nuture yourself on a mind body and spirit level selfcompassion allows you to turn inward and except all facets of who you are  it improves your capacity for love vulnerability emotional openness social interconnectedness and selfrespect  my philosophy is holistic collaborative and accepting  the cornerstone of my treatment philosophy is mindfulness and other evidenced based integrative modalities  i work as your ally to help you cultivate abundant selfcompassion in your life so that you can have the types of relationships you want

im a teenager and while ive never been to any kind of therapist i noticed i experience several anxiety symptoms i frequently find myself not going out and following my parent around the house i cant go into stores grocery stores specifically on my own and when i do i have to be on the phone with my dad the whole time i also forget things a lot,despite your anxiety you are highly attuned to your sense of well being and skillful in articulating the details of when anxiety takes oversometimes people who anxious in specific realtime situations are helped by talking themselves through the anxietymaybe youd be able to distract yourself from the grocery store anxiety by telling yourself youre anxious and that youll be ok its only a grocery storethe longer term way to dissolve anxiety is through selfacceptance selflove selfbelief basically all the areas of trusting yourself to handle situationsanxiety is a fear of being overwhelmed by a circumstance or condition which ends badly for youoften the person can very well handle the situation about which theyre anxious  the problem is not trusting themselves enough to rely on their self knowledge
im a teenager and while ive never been to any kind of therapist i noticed i experience several anxiety symptoms i frequently find myself not going out and following my parent around the house i cant go into stores grocery stores specifically on my own and when i do i have to be on the phone with my dad the whole time i also forget things a lot,with the way you described your anxiety it sounds like you have different types of anxiety im not sure whether you have anxiety of public places large crowds being alone  sometimes called separation anxiety or some combination thereofone thing that would be helpful would be to track your anxiety and see how anxious you are on a scale of 1 to 10 in different situations also if you know what leads up to your anxiety it would be good to know this as well so you can look for patternsas for forgetting things you could be anxious because you are forgetting things or you could be forgetting things because you are anxious when you are having anxiety certain parts of your brain are overactive because you are in a kind of protective mode its also possible that forgetting things and anxiety are not relatedsomething else to try would be to notice where you feel your anxiety in your body and put your hand there is a way of giving yourself comfortanother thing about anxiety is that having anxiety can lead to more worry about having more anxiety one thing that helps for some people is to go to the regular primary care doctor to make sure that there are no physical problems just for the regular physical so they know that there are no physical problems and that the anxiety will lessen in a few minutesalso if you are able to notice your feet on the floor or your hips in the chair this is helping you to be mindful of your body and connecting you to your surroundings during this in combination with naming your emotions can be soothing as well for example in the grocery store if you are feeling anxious you could say to yourself im anxious right now and im okay while gently shifting your weight from one foot to the other no one around you would notice what you were doing and the motion may be soothing to youanxiety can have a lot of different causes and things that trigger it if it is difficult for you to work it out on your own which is very common consider talking with a local therapist so you can have more specific ideasalso consider making a list of people who you trust and what it is about them that makes you feel comfortable
i am a really shy person im currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident how can i get more confident,wow congratulations on being in a masters program you are in a unique place so few have reached that level you should give yourself a pat on the backconfidence is not something that comes naturally but can and does come with practicehaving gone through two masters programs i can sympathize with your your dilemma so how is the stress affecting youis it serious enough to stop you from presenting or is it just butterfliesthere are many ways of dealing with the anxiety and stress much depends on how serious the stress isso here are a few ideas1 practice in front of a mirrorsounds strange but the practice helps2 ask some friends to listen to your presentations not so much for their input as to just get used to presenting3 focus on the material you are presenting the subject matter is what you want to get across step away from your nerves and get into the facts you want to present let the material you present be the focus 4 remember everyone else is just as nervous as you share your fears with some of your classmates and gain support from them focus on a friendly face during the presentation be a support to them in return5 fake it till you make it yes it sounds blunt but sometimes thats what it takes even if you feel like it you wont dieso much more can be discussed with a competent counselor take the time to let a professional help you work through thisagain you have come a long way to be in a graduate program congratulations you have done great work so far its just one step at a time take the steps
i am a really shy person im currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident how can i get more confident,a good way to start is the language or self talk that is happening inside your mind  looking at your question when it is said that the presentations make me feel stress you are giving the responsibility of the stress to the presentations and taking that away from your self  the presentations cannot give or take away your stress thats something only you can do and you can do it  what language can you change in your self talk  for example are you saying i cant speak in front of an audience ill fail  that sounds a lot different than i studied my butt off and if i practice speaking out loud i can ace this presentation  although this is a short answer i do believe that counseling will help you overcome these stressful feelings and bring out your inner confidence
i am a really shy person im currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident how can i get more confident,first of all way to go in stretching yourself out of your comfort zone you are sure to grow through all of this practice presenting to your peers and that in itself will help to grow your confidence over time in the meantime do whatever you can to help yourself feel prepared for each presentation do your work ahead of time so that you feel wellinformed on your topic and then spend the days leading up to your presentation practicing do your presentation in the mirror while you are driving if it wont distract you from the road and practice in front of a friend on the day of the presentation eat a balanced meal get a pep talk from a supportive friend use deep breathing to keep your body calm and remind yourself that you are prepared you got this
i am a really shy person im currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident how can i get more confident,have you tried rehearsing to yourself or a trusted friend what you will present to the class   the more confident you feel in a safe space the more chance there will be of making the same presentation to a larger groupgiving presentations is not necessarily a difficulty with communication  it has more to do with performance than expressing yourself clearlypractice practice and practice until you see yourself improve in how you presentalso keep in mind that whatever anxiety you may feel about making a mistake the audience is almost alway much more forgiving than the person who feels anxiousanxiety heightens fear so whatever concerns you have check if they are growing from anxiety instead of a realistic assessment of your abilities or audience receptivitygood luck
i am a really shy person im currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident how can i get more confident,i can offer you hypnosis for confidence in presentations via skype if youre in cali
i start counselingtherapy in a few days im freaking out but my main fear is that ill cry and embarrass myself is it something to worry about,oh crying in therapy is very normal i have a stack of kleenex boxes in my office cry away therapist are very used to it first time being in therapy is scary but youll soon know if you are a good match
i start counselingtherapy in a few days im freaking out but my main fear is that ill cry and embarrass myself is it something to worry about,people do cry in therapy sometimes but its not at all necessary to cry in order for most kinds of therapy to be helpful when you start counseling you dont yet know your counselor very well so its normal to keep your feelings in check until you feel comfortable and a bit more relaxed with your counselor and with the situation sometimes though there are emotions that have been waiting and waiting to finally find someone who will listen with a kind ear if you feel safe right away in the situation with your counselor you might just cry in spite of your fears about it your therapist is used to people expressing how they feel and will keep strict confidentiality so even though its embarrassing finally experiencing someone truly listening with empathy and kindness may just be worth it its okay too to let your counselor know right at the beginning that youre kind of freaked out about getting too emotional in front of another person
i start counselingtherapy in a few days im freaking out but my main fear is that ill cry and embarrass myself is it something to worry about,crying is a natural process when you talk about upsetting things especially in therapy when you are opening up and being so vulnerable i suggest that you consider how you would feelrespond to someone that was confiding to you and they began to cry if you felt concerned supportive and empathetic then you know exactly how us therapists feel when our clients are emotional in sessions i suggest that you think of times where you have cried and how you felt at that time in public and what would have helped to make you feel less uncomfortable during your tears i think of crying like any other natural reaction of our body such as sneezing laughing coughing you cant help but do those things and most people wont really judge negatively if you do it in public similarly crying is our bodys reaction when we are emotional whether it is tears of joy from a hilarious joke or from being upset if you are very uncomfortable about crying but willing to start therapy perhaps you can ask the therapist if you can turn your chair around if you begin crying this way you are not facing them and can self soothe without worrying about how you physically look at that timei wish you luck and you should be proud of yourself for starting therapy and i wish you a wonderful journey on this important path that you are embarking on
i start counselingtherapy in a few days im freaking out but my main fear is that ill cry and embarrass myself is it something to worry about,it is not uncommon to be a bit nervous meeting your therapist or another person for the first time your therapist understands that calling and getting an appointment was a big step for you and will do their best to put you at ease providing a safe environment for our clients includes not judging them and being comfortable with the information and emotions that they share with us it is ok to cry and to trust that the therapist will honor this as part of your process
i start counselingtherapy in a few days im freaking out but my main fear is that ill cry and embarrass myself is it something to worry about,yes if crying is how you are expressing an emotion then not only would it be normal but hopefully encouraged because its an important part of therapy to have a safe space to express your emotions we might encourage you to put words to the tears as well to help you expand on your experience and begin to make more sense of itas a therapist our job is help you open up and feel comfortable enough doing so i sincerely hope no therapist would ever shame you for whatever experience you are having in the room
i start counselingtherapy in a few days im freaking out but my main fear is that ill cry and embarrass myself is it something to worry about,it is is absolutely normal to cry in therapy i can understand wanting to keep everything together and put your best foot forward with everyone you come into contact with but it can be such a powerful experience to cry with somebody that can hear you and accept you its so brave of you to go and share yourself with your counselor i hope you will keep being brave as you begin healing
i start counselingtherapy in a few days im freaking out but my main fear is that ill cry and embarrass myself is it something to worry about,when talking about difficult issues it is very normal to cry crying is a natural way for us to cope with the sadness that we experience in life when confronting some of these things in a counseling session tears just seem to come naturally every counselor should be well equipped to handle that level of emotion and you would be far from the first to cry when talking with a counselor
i start counselingtherapy in a few days im freaking out but my main fear is that ill cry and embarrass myself is it something to worry about,hi there   as someone who has practiced as a clinical psychologist for 25 years  i would say that crying is nothing to worry about at all  almost every single person i have worked with has cried at one point or another  starting therapy takes a lot of courage when you work with a therapist once you feel safe   you talk about a lot of very private and potentially emotional things that you may have never discussed with anyone before  i have seen  people cry with sadness  cry with relief at releasing painful things they have held onto for a long time cry because they feel so relieved that they finally feel heard  i myself have sometimes cried with clients because some things they talk about are so profoundly moving   i can assure you that most  if not all  therapists expect clients to cry  and there is nothing to be embarrassed about  crying can be very cathartic and can allow us to release a lot of painful feelings we have been stuffing down  crying is  often a sign that you are really working things through and getting in touch with feelings that you need to get in touch with in order to heal so  to summarize  dont worry at all about crying it will probably feel uncomfortable  at first  but i promise you  you will not be judged for crying in therapy  and it will be less embarrassing once it happens a time or two and you are assured that your therapist will be there for you and wont judge you good luck 
i start counselingtherapy in a few days im freaking out but my main fear is that ill cry and embarrass myself is it something to worry about,lots of people do cry in session but your therapist wont be uneasy with this  crying is a natural response and it also releases toxins so some might say its necessary  remember that you can be in charge of what you talk about in your session and if theres something that feels too uncomfortable just say im not ready to talk about that  your counselor wants  you to feel at ease and will probably not push you right away to a very uncomfortable place  as you get to know your therapist you will feel more relaxed and even not worry so much about how you appear to them  its normal to be anxious going into a new situation especially when you might not feel in control of uncomfortable emotions  dont give up go and put your best effort in hope that helps allison
i start counselingtherapy in a few days im freaking out but my main fear is that ill cry and embarrass myself is it something to worry about,many people cry during their therapy sessions actually most people cry in their therapists office i tell my clients that its safe to cry in my office and crying isnt a sign of weakness its a normal human response to pain people actually do more harm to themselves by trying not to cry than by crying crying is very cleansing and an important part of the healing process for many people
i start counselingtherapy in a few days im freaking out but my main fear is that ill cry and embarrass myself is it something to worry about,please feel free to cry during therapy if you suddenly feel painful emotions arising when you describe some of your unsatisfying and unfulfilling relationships and situationscrying when realizing the emotional hurt and unfairness between you and someone clears you for new ways of handling interactionsas a therapist i always have a box of tissues on the table next to the couch where people who utilize my therapy siti hope you will soon discover that once your tears unlock your awareness of harmful relationships in your life you will quickly see the freedom to establish new and happier patterns of relatinghave a good therapy
i start counselingtherapy in a few days im freaking out but my main fear is that ill cry and embarrass myself is it something to worry about,please do not worry about crying people cry laugh rage rant and talk during counseling sessions part of the therapy process is to look at your feelings and to feel what you are actually feeling instead of what you think you should feel so if you need to cry thats ok if you feel embarrassed because you cried or if you feel anxious that you might cry well those feelings are ok as well your counselor can help you manage your feelings so that you can attain your goals and your counseling session is the perfect place for that
i feel too scared to meet people i dont know  even relatives i dont ever raise my hand or talk in school i feel like no one understands how can i handle this,social anxiety is scary you dont feel safe in relationships and prefer to isolate yourself from the outside world is it something you can talk to your parents about a school counselor could help you the counselor could possibly order an evaluation to determine how to helpbuild your self confidence  start slow with your family and identify a subject you are familiar with and add to a general conversation its important to start finding things in common with others you dont need to carry the conversations just add a phrase or two have an exit strategy if you get too uncomfortable keep notes of what worked and what didnt work so youll be prepared for your next opportunity carpe diem
i feel too scared to meet people i dont know  even relatives i dont ever raise my hand or talk in school i feel like no one understands how can i handle this,it certainly sounds like you have some anxiety before deciding whether it was social anxiety or a more general type of anxiety i would wonder what it is that you think will result from you raising your hand or talking to someone you dont know here is some information on social anxiety httpssocialanxietyinstituteorgwhatissocialanxietyi would recommend talking to a local mental health professional it sounds like your anxiety is affecting your daily life and there are lots of strategies that may help to lessen thatthanks for being brave to post here
i feel too scared to meet people i dont know  even relatives i dont ever raise my hand or talk in school i feel like no one understands how can i handle this,congratulations on your courage to ask this questionthis shows you are willing to engage with other people just not in all situations especially the in person onesstart by meeting yourselfreflect as thoroughly as possible as to what you imagine will be the outcome of meeting others or of speaking up during a classsome people are afraid of being criticized or judged by other people or do this to themselves inwardly  if you are judging or criticizing yourself to be less worthy of having opinions or views or of being who you are than others then the thought of actually placing yourself in this situation would feel intolerableone way to move out from this position of feeling less than others is to recognize that these feelings are inside of youthen it is possible to know at least on an intellectual level that it is not true that any one person is superior to anotherall the people whom you are afraid to meet also have their own insecuritieswe are all equal in worth and in having blindspots about ourselvesalso it is possible that you are naturally shy and may be expecting more from yourself than is reasonable in terms of a standard about meeting othersyou may have a few fears of being judged unfairly you may also simply not enjoy being around people very muchbe aware to not push yourself beyond your natural limits  overcoming fears of being judged is different than forcing yourself to do what is against your basic nature
im a male in my early 20s lately my paranoia about being around kids is causing me too breathe heavy and sweat a lot i then start to act weird because im trying to fight my paranoia this leads to people starring at me because they dont know that im suffering from panic attacks and paranoia they just notice me acting scared around kids and they think im a threat because of it im not a pervert or predator i would never hurt a kid i like kids and dont know why im so scared to be around them i dont understand why i feel like this am i a bad person how do i make this stop,in our practice many people we see have unwanted thoughts of doing harm to children  physically or sexually as you said these are intrusive and unwanted thoughts  not genuine desires to harm them this is a form of ocd we often call harm or pedophilic ocd what you are describing here as paranoia sounds similar to this and is so demoralizing because you are dealing both with the distress of these unwanted thoughts and feelings as well as the fear and uncertainty about your own character as a good personif this is really what is going on further assessment by the right professional would determine this the current gold standard approach to addressing ocd is exposure with response prevention  in this case confronting the feared situations thoughts or images on purpose rather than avoiding them until they lose the fear and shame associated with them

ive known him for about six years weve dated off and on i hadnt seen him in close to three years but recently started seeing him again i really want this to last this time i stayed the night do i text call or make contact first the same day of the morning i left his house,it is possible your question reflects some insecurity about whether or not either or you would like this relationship to continueotherwise the answer to your question would appear naturally  if you genuinely feel close enough to this person to sleep with him then who texts whom first wouldnt really matter too muchtry to understand within yourself whether you feel truly interested in this person as much as you would like to feel toward someone
ive known him for about six years weve dated off and on i hadnt seen him in close to three years but recently started seeing him again i really want this to last this time i stayed the night do i text call or make contact first the same day of the morning i left his house,i dont see why you cant call text or make contact first it would be up to him to reply when he can and wants to but i dont know why you couldnt initiate contactone thing to consider as you get to know each other better is having conversations about conversations for example you could say id like to call or text you more often but im concerned about _____ listing what you are most worried about then he can discuss his reaction and you can have a dialogue about it
example would be homecoming i was at my high schools home football game on friday and i left because i felt uncomfortable with all the people there and i just wanted to be by myself why is that,hi im amelia oh that is so frustrating have you ever heard of social anxiety sounds like you may be suffering from it here is a link to a quiz httpswwwpsycomnetsocialanxietytestbesides being a therapist i am a mom to 10 kids a couple of my kids are very uncomfortable with crowds and become very anxious find yourself a therapist who can assess you and spend time with you to address these issues and to help you learn tools to help you navigate these emotionsi am wishing you the best
i am a female and in my early teens i dont want to feel afraid of people when i meet someone i know that they are okay but i still feel afraid,maybe the problem is learning to trust yourself to not be afraid other peoplereflect on what you believe would increase your trust of believing your own judgement on whom to trustif youve had any type of violation during your growing up years or witnessed someone in your family be violated emotionally physically or through some terrible accident or incident then you may hesitate to believe other people are safe and not to be fearedgive yourself plenty of time and reassurance that as long as you are making sincere effort to increase you comfort around other people eventually you will succeed
my son was diagnosed with autism a few years ago and i stopped working so that i could take care of him i also was dealing with an abusive relationship mentally physically and emotionally now i live like a recluse and i always feel nervous around people how can i feel more comfortable around other people,theres a lot of layers there to your situation and im focusing on two layers that may be contributing to your feelings of discomfort around others one layer is the daunting news that your son has autism many parents can feel overwhelmed and distraught with this diagnosis the vast array of treatments available is daunting in and of itself at times to wrap ones head around taking time to reflect or seek out therapy regarding how this diagnosis has impacted you may be helpful some parents feel their individual identity gets lost in the diagnosis because they have dropped everything to help their child and others may experience guilt if either of these or other feelings come to the forefront for you it may be worth working through them with a therapist a support group list is available through wwwautismspeaksorg and may help connect you with others raising children with autisma second layer is the abusive relationship you were involved in the trauma you experienced in this relationship may have a very meaningful impact on your ability to trust and to be intimate with others engaging with a therapist can help facilitate the healing process as well as paving the way for more comfortable and trusting relationships
my son was diagnosed with autism a few years ago and i stopped working so that i could take care of him i also was dealing with an abusive relationship mentally physically and emotionally now i live like a recluse and i always feel nervous around people how can i feel more comfortable around other people,it might be helpful to have a good understanding of the why in terms of feeling nervous around people or the difficulty in developing more comfort if your discomfort is somehow related to your sons diagnosis or your lack of employment or an abusive relationship you were in and maybe embarrassed about that is important to understand and get clarity around when we can understand on a deep level what is happening for us ie where does fear come into this and whats it about we can give ourselves empathy everyone struggles in some aspect so to not necessarily think of yourself as pathological is a first step sometimes being around people can trigger an anxiety related to being good enough that goes back a ways in our history if any of the above is true it would need acknowledgement and care from you as opposed to shaming that experience in the hopes it would just go away because this experience is very real for you
my son was diagnosed with autism a few years ago and i stopped working so that i could take care of him i also was dealing with an abusive relationship mentally physically and emotionally now i live like a recluse and i always feel nervous around people how can i feel more comfortable around other people,id wonder first if you were still in the same home and neighborhood where you raised your son and experienced the abuse in many ways we react to our environments  and if youre still surrounded by neighbors who didnt reach out when they heard your ex yelling or offer assistance and resources when your son acted differently than his peers it might make sense that youre more timid around folks it might also be worth thinking about where your bar is set do you want to be as comfortable around people as you were before your recent circumstances or find your new normal and connect only with people who raise you up and bolster your selfesteem you have the right to be both cautious if youre still surrounded by the same folks and environment and discerning  only connecting with people who will be supportive all the best
my son was diagnosed with autism a few years ago and i stopped working so that i could take care of him i also was dealing with an abusive relationship mentally physically and emotionally now i live like a recluse and i always feel nervous around people how can i feel more comfortable around other people,it sounds like you have taken on a caretaker role for a while as well as experienced some pretty severe interpersonal trauma  it makes sense that you would feel nervous around people  working through the trauma of an abusive relationship in itself can be a difficult process  and then to add on the caretaker part can make things even more difficult  first off you may want to seek support to work through what you have experienced  many cities offer support with survivors of domestic violence and there is a hotline to help with this 8887247240 as well as online resources  processing the isolation of this relationship as well as working with your son can help to overcome the anxiety related to others  accessing autism support networks may be of support as well  other parents that will understand your experiences are a good and tend to be safer place to start in attempting to connect to othersvery importantly go slow and be kind to yourself as you begin to adapt to a new life of allowing others to care for you as you so clearly have for others
my son was diagnosed with autism a few years ago and i stopped working so that i could take care of him i also was dealing with an abusive relationship mentally physically and emotionally now i live like a recluse and i always feel nervous around people how can i feel more comfortable around other people,i would look at  getting engaged with a support network of individuals who may also have autistic children  they will understand some of the things that you are experiencing at home and you may also find someone who feels that same way as you if you have not sought professional counseling for the abusive relationship i would seek out a therapist who can help you process through it so you do not repeat similar choices in your next relationship
my son was diagnosed with autism a few years ago and i stopped working so that i could take care of him i also was dealing with an abusive relationship mentally physically and emotionally now i live like a recluse and i always feel nervous around people how can i feel more comfortable around other people,probably a good portion of living like a recluse was necessary so you had time to rest and recuperate from so much major adjustment in your lifehave you told some of the people in your life about the many changes youve been through  it is possible people sense something different about you and arent sure whether to ask or not ask questionsalso understand what type of qualities youd like to offer and receive in a friendship  given that raising a kid who has autism takes a lot of energy and time the way you socialize will changestart with one person whom youre pretty sure would welcome you and whom you would gain by bringing them into your lifeas a result of how this interaction goes how you decide to spend your time together what youll discuss you will know more about yourself and what you require to feel good around other peoplethen you can consider if youre ready to add others into your world
sometimes im fine and can go out or meet people but other days my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth ive always thought it was normal and i was just nervous but the other day it took me almost 30 minutes of sitting in my car to find the courage to enter target by myself,it is possible that you could have or be developing an anxiety disorder there isnt really enough information provided here to suggest a particular disorder but it might be worth meeting with a counselor or therapist to do a formal assessment some of the questions they might ask could be what other kinds of physical symptoms you experience how frequently these physical symptoms happen whats going on for you when they tend to happen and how frequentlyintensely you find yourself worrying in general anxiety itself is a really natural thing  its just when it starts interfering with your ability to do life the way you want that we start to consider potential disorders it might be that for the most part the anxiety you feel is normal and you simply have some triggers that intensify it more than usual working on your own or with the support of a counselortherapist to both address those triggers at the root and also to develop ways of managing the actual anxiety symptoms this twofold approach can be really helpful for not letting anxiety keep you from engaging in life the way youd like
sometimes im fine and can go out or meet people but other days my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth ive always thought it was normal and i was just nervous but the other day it took me almost 30 minutes of sitting in my car to find the courage to enter target by myself,these types of symptoms can be very disruptive to life  anxiety often presents in two key ways  1 physical symptoms such as racing heart rate sweaty palms dry mouth shaking or trembling or nausea  often these physical sypmtoms are categorized as a panic attack  2 mentally anxiety presents itself as worry  worry that spirals out of control worry that dirsupts your life and concentration  worry that keeps from being present in your life  anxiety when it begins to spiral out of control either with disruptive mental or physical symptoms needs to be addressed formally  i urge you to see a counselor andor a psychiatrist soon to begin to address these issues  good luck sitka stueve lscsw
sometimes im fine and can go out or meet people but other days my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth ive always thought it was normal and i was just nervous but the other day it took me almost 30 minutes of sitting in my car to find the courage to enter target by myself,feelings of anxiety can be scary and sometimes were not aware of the triggers that lead up to moments of anxiety i e heart racing sweaty palms sweating shortness of breath its important to realize that in moments of anxiety our body  mind are experiencing a reaction from our primal or reptilian brain that is signaling the flight or fight response within us which kicks the hypothalamus into action flooding our body with chemicals like adrenaline or cortisol  so one way to work with anxiety is to find out what the triggers are that lead to anxiety such as fear stress negative thought patterns not enough food or sleep keeping a daily journal can help you track the patterns and triggers and once you identify the triggers you can ameliorate them by learning new skills  techniques and by reducing stress and getting enough sleep one quick way to reduce anxiety is by taking deeper breathes sometimes this is called belly breathing when you breath in make sure your belly rises and expands and as you breath out the belly deflates many of us do shallow breathing up in our chest which does not allow for a full breath and getting a full breath is so important as a tool to help relax us in times of stress  anxiety

sometimes im fine and can go out or meet people but other days my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth ive always thought it was normal and i was just nervous but the other day it took me almost 30 minutes of sitting in my car to find the courage to enter target by myself,your sitting in your car for 30 minutes story sounds so sad and frustratingyes youre describing classic symptoms of anxietyanxiety itself is the indirect result of repeatedly being in positions of feeling helpless or frightenedare you able to recall from your growing up years of feeling insecureyou may not have felt loved and nurtured as much as you neededsome people develop anxiety from missing enough love  they feel lacking in ability to take care of themselves similar to the lack of being sufficiently taken care of when youngertry understanding if you felt neglected emotionallyif yes then start the slow process of emotionally rewarding and acknowledging yourselfprogress will be sloweventually youll stabilize the way you feel toward yourselfthis will gradually result in decreased anxiety

a lot of times i avoid situations where i am to meet new people because i have a fear of embarrassing myself i often avoid large groups of people like parties because i think they all constantly judge me,hello and thank you for your question first i want you to know that you are certainly not alone on this issue everyone at some point in time has a fear of public embarrassment but for many people this fear can become so awful that it begins to have a real negative impact on their quality of life  they will try to avoid any situation that they even think will cause them embarrassment or anxiety escaping a possible embarrassing moment by avoiding or isolating may cause some relief at first but then many times the avoidance will eventually lead to loneliness isolation and even despair by avoiding we can also miss out on things that make us feel alive and bring enjoyment there are many selfhelp books that offer advice on this issue you can do an internet search and i recommend reading the reviews of the book that is great way to find out if others have found the book helpful another option is to seek a counselor to help you with this fear i would recommend a counselor who specializes in helping people who have anxiety or social anxiety acceptance and commitment therapy is a good choice for helping with anxiety but there are many others the truth is that anxiety and fear of embarrassing ourselves is not something that any of us will ever get over but we can learn to respond to those feelings differently a colleague may offer some other advice as well be wellrobin landwehr dbh lpc ncc
a lot of times i avoid situations where i am to meet new people because i have a fear of embarrassing myself i often avoid large groups of people like parties because i think they all constantly judge me,why not accept and tolerate that you naturally are a shy person who doesnt like large groupsthis is not necessarily something to get over if it is part of who you arepeople have the capacity to judge others regardless of whether the group is large or smallif you arent afraid of being judged in small groups then study the factors which allow you to feel safe in small groups possibly you can generalize your findings to large group venuesif you try the and arent successful then likely you simply arent naturally someone who cares for large group settingsnot everything a person doesnt like is a symptom of something is wrong w the person
my partner lives in canada while i live in the us we visit each other but we go months in between visits i have anxiety and im always anxious about him cheating or still having feelings for an ex that he dated for three years he doesnt understand my anxiety how do i stop myself from worrying so much,would you worry less if you and your partner had a plan as to when you will be together as a couplelong distance relationships are not for everybody  some people need the daily or frequent interaction to feel securethe question is not so much how to deal with anxiety that your partner is cheating on you than whether your own emotional and relationship requirements are satisfied with a long distance relationshipanyway cheating has nothing to do with distance since married people cheat while living together for years under the same roof
i just about fall asleep then i cant help but sit up and walk around,maybe you are afraid to let go of your problems for a few hoursalthough you didnt write this usually what keeps people awake or prevents them from falling asleep are worries about certain situations in their livesif this describes you then maybe talk with yourself to convince you that you are entitled to a good nights sleepreally we all are and feeling rested from the day and lifes tensions will better you to handle whatever the particular matters arealso maybe you will be more enthusiastic to go to bed if you have a comfy mattress and nice pillows  make your bed an inviting place because this will tempt you to enjoy relaxing enough to go to sleep
i have severe anxiety and have tried everything everything makes it worstthe only thing that helps is my emotional support animal,sorry to read of your sufferingis it actually permitted that people are able to take support animals to schooli see your point of the animal helping you  i just also see the point that some people have allergies to animal hair or dander or may feel distracted by an animal in the classroomyou may end up feeling worse if when you bring your support animal to school that it disturbs people or interferes with the routines of the classfor your anxiety i suggest some loving kindness toward yourself  be patient with yourself and that you have anxiety  if youre able to accept that some situations create great discomfort for you maybe youll tolerate these difficult situationembrace your anxiety as part of you basically rather than trying to banish it which because it actually is part of you is impossible to achievein a way im suggesting you become your own support animal  love yourself be kind to yourself and see if you feel a little less stressed in school
im just an extremely paranoid person i constantly feel as though i am in some sort of danger like as though i live in a horror movie with no resolution it worsens at night it gets to the point im scared in my own home more so than anything i have no access to the help i need so im desperate,one approach is to be more accepting of yourself as someone who has fearsit is much easier to manage a problem when youre not fighting yourself for having a problemonce you are willing to accept this quality within yourself you may start to feel a little more relaxed about handling the fears when they ariseone answer is to examine the facts about the fears  ask yourself fact based questions as to how you would handle the worse case scenario of your fearsfeeling prepared whether or not the circumstance is highly unlikely to happen may increase your peace of mind with living the great fears within your mind
i dont know if im normal im really scared to touch a girl im a young adult and a virgin my fiancãe and i want to have sex soon and this might mess everything up because she wants a baby soon as well,your question is a good onethe best way to decrease the fear would be to talk with your fiancee about it  eventually shell find out and better to talk about it when there is less pressure than to be in the midst of a situation which frightens youalso she may feel similar to you who knowsdiscussing a topic which relates directly to your relationship is a good way to increase emotional intimacy  and emotional intimacy has a lot to do with feeling at ease with physical intimacy
i dont understand why this is happening why do i feel this way,the short answer i could give is that we dont know why its happening the longer answer could come from deeper exploration as to your fears or anxieties that you experience maybe just thinking of going outside but any sort of exploration about this almost has to begin with an agreement within you and all of your feelings thats its not something to be ashamed of if we are ashamed of any of our behaviors then we lose the ability to sit with them and see where they are coming from this could be something that can be worked through in therapy and specifically with a therapist who specializes in anxiety and more specifically agoraphobia
i dont understand why this is happening why do i feel this way,the first step to answer your question is to reflect on what is going on in your life overall  if youre in the midst of severe stress whether within your relationship or effort to establish a relationship upheaval in family dynamics some type of significant loss like a job or someone with whom you feel closely attached then you may simply be creating the solitude which is necessary to better understand and absorb the meaning of these changesi assume you mean you are by yourself when you are indoorswhat you write sounds like youre not happy with this recent urge rather than that you and someone or others are having great and fun times togetherone way to encourage yourself to go back outdoors is to connect w a friend or search for an interest within you to developthis way with either of these youd feel a little bit of motivation to join and get more involved with either of these
i am a peaceful person but i often find myself having thoughts about killing people eventhough i like the thoughts at the time they make me cry why do i feel like this,maybe because you have great emotional pain stored inside you of which you are not aware existssometimes people who feel greatly hurt by others or who feel unloved by others imagine if they do the opposite of love which is to kill that they will get the recognition and acknowledgement from others which they wish would come to them in a loving waythis is my theory it is not necessarily a definitive description of your inner dynamicmost important is to keep an open mind to selfdiscovery on your feelings including the ones which are uneasy such as killing to consider
i am a peaceful person but i often find myself having thoughts about killing people eventhough i like the thoughts at the time they make me cry why do i feel like this,hello and thank you for your question clearly this is something that has you very concerned sometimes thoughts are just thoughts and they are pretty harmless many people have thoughts of killing someone but they would never actually do it they really dont even want to do it they are just having a thought other times thoughts are a sign of something more serious and we should receive help when they start to worry us i would recommend meeting with a counselor to discuss these thoughts it is usually a safe environment where you can get advice with little judgement now if you begin to start thinking about killing someone specific and making a plan to do it in reality you should call for help immediately by help i mean 911 or a family member or friend you would want to get help before doing something to harm yourself and others again none of this is to judge but rather to encourage you to get the help youre seeking either way when we become concerned about some aspect of our behavior seeking counseling is usually a good choice be well robin j landwehr dbh lpcc ncc
i shake and have panic attacks,one way to understand panic attacks is as a sign of feeling insecure or lacking confidence in a certain area or characteristic of yourselfthe insecurity can sometimes feel overwhelming and this starts the sense of panic one way to build your sense of security within yourself is to have a simple life and a slow paced life   when there are many activities or involvements to pay attention then it is easy to not give full attention to all of them  this may trigger a sense of insecurity since in fact you may not have had sufficient time to study and know your own opinion about all of what your life is immersed ina simpler life of fewer activities allows more time to know and understand your own inner feelings and reactionsto know more about yourself may help build your confidence and security in your ability to know and live what goes on in your life
i shake and have panic attacks,one of the first things i would suggest is to see if you can keep track of what is leading you to feel anxious if you shake all the time consider talking with your primary care physician sometimes that can be a hormonal imbalance or another chemical imbalance such as thyroidone of the most difficult things about anxiety is that having anxiety particularly panic attacks can lead to anxiety about having more panic attacks also remember that panic attacks are typically part of your brains protective response to what it considers to be some sort of threat you may have heard of the fight or flight response when you have an anxiety attack your body is preparing you to react to something that isnt actually a threat so its almost as if youre fight or flight response is overactive here is an image that may be helpful httppsychologytoolsfightorflightresponsehtmlthere are many different things you can do you can practice breathing mindfulness meditation or yoga techniques if you decide to try some breathing techniques try breathing in for a count of five holding for a count of five breathing out for a count of five and repeating five timesalso remember that it is easier to learn these techniques when youre not having a panic attack at that point it can be really difficult to use methods to not panic also remember that panic attacks typically last 5 to 10 minutes using techniques to slow your breathing or become focused on the room around you is probably most helpful when you first start to feel anxioushere are some other techniques that may help to decrease anxiety httppsychcentralcomlib9waystoreduceanxietyrighthererightnowas you figure out what is leading up to your anxiety also consider asking yourself what is making that certain issue a big concern for you another important question could be when you have felt that way before
i havent been feeling like myself lately ive been upset for no reason and feeling anxious im feeling burnt out what can help me feel better,does it help to put a name to the experience you are having where you first said ive been upset for no reason and feeling anxious you then say that you are feeling burnt out which gives a little more context to what may have once felt like no reason perhaps you are feeling burnt out that is a big deal and please try not to take it lightly when we get burnt out i have found that its from one of two things either we are not doing what we want or we are doing too much either of something we want or something we dont doesnt really matter once we get into doing too muchif either of those rings true for your experience try as much as possible to sit with the experience and get a better sense of where the burn out is coming from i wrote about burnout for a newsletter and it is on my website i dont want to do shameless promotion but i thought it could also add to helping you httpsdavidkleintherapycommyexperienceswithburnouti hope that you can also see that its not an abnormal experience
i havent been feeling like myself lately ive been upset for no reason and feeling anxious im feeling burnt out what can help me feel better,theres no such possibility that youre upset for no reasonthe reason is not obvious not that you are feeling upset in response to nothing at allwhat can help you feel better is to be kind and gentle with yourself because this sort of approach will more likely relax your mood and mindset enough for the tension and anxiety you feel to dissipate somewhattry to understand whether certain situations or interactions remind you or feel similar to ones which distressed you beforethis may be the reason for your anxietyit is good news that you know the difference between your usual sense of yourself and that youve been away from this feelinggive yourself a little credit for understanding yourself  giving credit adds confidence and confidence will help you find the reasons and new ways to handle your anxiety
i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it but i dont know how what can i do,fears are not that difficult to deal with first you need to train yourself to relax using some relaxation strategy once you are able to employ that in your daily life you then need to start facing your fear for instance ill use an example of a man who has a fear of driving over a bridge we would build a hierarchy of fears that is a list of fears ranging from least to most for example the man may want to start by looking at a picture of a bridge while employing his relation technique then he may want to see a real bridge from a distance while employing that same relaxation technique then moving closer to the bridge then maybe standing on a bridge all the while moving closer to his fear while relaxing until you come to most fearful proposition which is crossing that bridge or you can also engage in flooding which is for example if you were scared of an elevator go into an elevator until you are not panicking anymore in the movie batman begins bruce wayne who has a great fear of bats goes into this cave and allows himself to be surrounded by bats until he is no longer fearful of them secondly look at your fears do they even need to be worked on some fears are healthy for example if i was a therapist in new york city and someone came to me and said im scared of snakes i would probably say that is ok because there are very little snakes left in manhattanhope that helps c
i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it but i dont know how what can i do,your fear may have deeper roots within your sense of who you are than you realize  fears are sometimes irrational so that logic doesnt get rid of themthink about whether you felt secure and confident as a child  also did any major bad events happen to you with other people or situations when you were growing upoften these overwhelming situations of childhood stay with us as fears of situations in our adult lives  if the root of the problem w the fear is from long ago then probably a therapist who can ask you questions which help you remember upsetting childhood circumstances may help you to dissolve the current fearanother possibility is cbt cognitive behavior therapy which teaches people short term mantras to do something which is safe say being a passenger in a commercial airplane which feels frightening to a personcbt is short term and results are limited to specific fears  it is a much quicker approach than selfunderstanding
i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it but i dont know how what can i do,fear is a part of life in fact our five main emotions are joy fear sadness shame and anger we tend to spend a lot of time and energy running away from or trying to get rid of most of those emotions and the more we do that the more we set ourselves up for failure and disappointment as a result of viewing our human emotions as bad or wrong we often get caught up in a trap of thinking we have to overcome them or get rid of them before we can do what matters to us in reality you can do what is important to you while having your fears my question for you is what would you do if this fear was completely gone what behaviors would you have if you were the ideal you what skills knowledge or personal qualities would you develop what kind of relationships would you havei imagine your fear has kept you from achieving those goals because your mind tells you you cant do it until the fear is gone i challenge you to do the following exercisewhat is a goal you would like to achieve example i would like to change careerswhat actions are necessary to complete this goal example see a career counselor to determine my ideal career go back to schoolget a certification network with others in my desired industrywhat thoughts feelings or urges might get in my way example thoughts of what if i fail im not smart enough i cant do it im too busy to put energy into this feelings of fear shame excitement urges to distract myself through drinking or watch tv instead of taking actionit would be helpful to remind myself that example it is natural to have these thoughts feelings and urges but i can take action anyway i deserve to have a fulfilling lifethe smallest and easiest step i can take now example research career counselors in my area and write down their phone numbersthe time day and date that i will take that first step is example tonight at 7pm at least think through these answers but it is most beneficial to write them down i hope this helps
i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it but i dont know how what can i do,this answer could be very different depending on the fear the degree of it and what it connects toi wonder the followingon a scale of 1 to 10 how upset anxious or scared to you get when you think about overcoming this if its more than a 510 i would definitely recommend talking with a therapist in your areaa lot of fears that we have come from something that at one time was selfprotective and important do you know where your fear started if you think it is still protecting you or helping you in some way talk with someone like a therapist about itif it is something that you know is irrational for example fear of being hurt by static cling from winter clothing is there some part of that that you are not afraid ofi really encourage you to consider whether your fear has a lot of emotions connected to it or if it ties from something in your past that was very emotional for you at the time if it does consider working with a therapist to establish emotional safety before taking away the fear or anxiety that may actually be helpful to youalso the fact that you notice that you are afraid of something and you dont want to be afraid of it anymore is a big step in the forward direction
i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it but i dont know how what can i do,biologically fear is designed to protect us from harm fear is not always a bad thing and in fact can be quite healthy and appropriate depending on the situation a phobia however is different you used the term fear rather than phobia a phobia is an irrational fear  meaning it is not rational for you to fear that thing if your situation is a phobia exposure therapy can help this consists of gradually exposing yourself a little at a time to the thing you are afraid of some people with phobias find that the irrational fear interferes with their life and they do need to overcome it someone who is afraid to drive over bridges may go to great lengths to avoid routes that have bridges people who are afraid of elevators may always use the stairs instead which may not always be feasible if overcoming a phobia will improve the quality of your life then by all means seek professional help to overcome iteveryone has fears or things that make them nervous public speaking asking a person out fear of failure examine what your fear is and try to determine the reason for the fear when you can get to the root cause of the fear you can deal with that issue a lot of times it is a selfesteem issue you may be able to peel back the layers of the fear and find out whats causing it and deal with the real issue some fears are caused by trauma someone with ptsd is going to have an exaggerated fear response and will find themselves being kicked into fight or flight mode over things that someone without the trauma experience wouldnt notice or react to in cases like this exposure therapy would be the wrong approach and could actually make things worse if there is a possibility that a past trauma is the cause of your fear i strongly urge you to seek a therapist  not just any therapist but one who is trained to work with trauma and abuse victims
i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it but i dont know how what can i do,hello and thank you for your question overcoming fears is something that everyone struggles with at one time or another sometimes we come across something that scares us we push through it and suddenly we arent afraid anymore but sometimes it can seem like our fears just take over and we cannot overcome them there are some options1 you can go to a counselor and receive some type of treatment what kind of treatment would depend on the type of fears you are experiencing for example if you have a general phobia about something they may use various techniques to help you manage it 2 there are different websites and even some selfhelp books that you can use to try to overcome your fears when it comes to overcoming certain fears or phobias exposure therapy wellstudied and proven to work a therapist would help you with this but some websites give instructions for how to do it yourself i am not sure how well it works when you try it by yourself but here is a link to a website that does offer some tools httppsychologytoolsanxietyhtmlsome colleagues may offer you some other types of advice be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpcc ncc
i dont remember when the voices in my head started but i remember hearing them when i was little i know its not normal to hear voices that arent your own i fight the voices and i want them to stop theyve been here so long and i want them gone how can i make the voices stop,how is your life going overallsince you hear voices since you were young i wonder whether you mean the thoughts each of us has about what to do our opinions including selfcriticism and praisei try to understand how severe a problem these voices are if youve managed to get to a point in life of awareness about the voicesusually when mental health people hear about voices the immediate thought is you need drugs bc you are psychoticsince this is going on for a number of years i wonder if the problem is something different
i dont remember when the voices in my head started but i remember hearing them when i was little i know its not normal to hear voices that arent your own i fight the voices and i want them to stop theyve been here so long and i want them gone how can i make the voices stop,you are right it is not normal to hear voices that arent your own but the fact is some people do in my experience medication seem to help it is also important to understand when you hear voices the most  meaning it is important to understand what the triggers are it is also important to understand when the voices are the least  meaning what helps you deal with the voices better my clients have reported that their triggers are being in social gathering or around strangers or for some even the tv trying to identify your triggers is helpful for some people clients have also reported that listening to music watching tv being with friend or family helps them deal with their voices every individual is different and you need to figure out what works for you and what triggers your voices my suggestion is to see a therapist  health care provider and then go from therei hope this helps
i dont remember when the voices in my head started but i remember hearing them when i was little i know its not normal to hear voices that arent your own i fight the voices and i want them to stop theyve been here so long and i want them gone how can i make the voices stop,first let me express my support and compassion for what youre going through hearing voices can be incredibly difficult and can feel like you cant get a moments peace even in the privacy of your own mind and not everyone will necessarily understand what youre dealing with so i imagine you may also be feeling isolated or somehow different atta girlboy on reaching out for help many people find benefit to taking medications such as risperdal seroquel and so on these should be prescribed by a nurse practitioner or psychiatrist  i do not recommend a primary care doctor venture into this area as a general rule discuss the options thoroughly and insist on a good rapport with your prescriber if you decide to go this route some people are having results with a talktherapist to develop coping strategies there is a new and somewhat less conventional approach to challenging voices with a professional to assist you rather than to suppress the voices which medication will do there is peerrun organization and a general approach that attempts to live with voices in a different way  you can read about it in living with voices by marius romme i have heard interviews but have not read the books and cant speak to its efficacy no matter what steps you decide to try managing your stress sleep exercise healthy food is essential  in other words just the daily care and feeding of yourself should be included in all of your efforts and bears surprising benefits to your brain and emotional health best wishes to youkaren keys lmhc casac
i dont remember when the voices in my head started but i remember hearing them when i was little i know its not normal to hear voices that arent your own i fight the voices and i want them to stop theyve been here so long and i want them gone how can i make the voices stop,this isnt something you can do on your own if you havent already you need to see a medical doctor asap to rule out medical causes for this many diseases illnesses and conditions can cause hallucinations in the elderly sometimes its something as simple as a urinary tract infection some medicines may have that side effect as wellhowever you say youve been hearing them since you were little i have no idea how old you are now but something that has been going on for many years does lead me to think it could be a type of schizophrenia a psychiatrist could diagnose that after taking a complete look at your history medical history etc there are medications that they can put you on that will help one thing that i find encouraging is that you recognize youre hearing voices this means you are not so far into a delusion as to believe it is real a lot of people that hear or see things that arent there are not able to have the awareness that these things are not real they fully believe what theyre hearingseeing its completely real to them because you have the awareness that you do i feel this is a very good sign that with treatment you can live a normal life assuming you are not already receiving treatment for it if you are and are still hearing the voices please know that medications often need to be changed and adjusted and the voices may never completely go away but medicines certainly help dull them a lot always talk to your doctor when it seems your symptoms are getting worse so that they can make the necessary medication adjustments for youif at any time the voices are telling you to do something please go to an er as this is an emergency sometimes people hear voices telling them to harm themselves harm someone else or do other things that are against the law do not try to deal with something like that on your own there are people who can help
ive hit my head on walls and floors ever since i was young i sometimes still do it but i dont exactly know why i have anxiety and i had a rough childhood but now ill start to hit my head and sometimes not realize it but i dont know how to stop or even why im doing it how can i help myself to change my behavior,give yourself a lot of empathy and care for having had a rough childhood and realizing that life can be better than how you were treated when growing upbe patient with yourself too bc lasting change takes time alternatives to hitting your head require constant gentle reminders to do these new behaviors or if youve discovered a satisfying alternative in one moment time is required for you to repeat this alternative until it feels naturalanxiety usually means someone did not feel well understood growing up and was rushed to comply with the wishes of others who were a regular part of their livesanxiety lessens as the person starts to know and accept their wishes and needs as valid  allow yourself to learn who you truly are in the spirit of accepting whatever you discover about yourselfthe behaviors will naturally change with your new understanding and self acceptancegood luck and enjoy this self discovery project
ive hit my head on walls and floors ever since i was young i sometimes still do it but i dont exactly know why i have anxiety and i had a rough childhood but now ill start to hit my head and sometimes not realize it but i dont know how to stop or even why im doing it how can i help myself to change my behavior,hello i have to wonder from a behavioral perspective if what you are doing is useful for you in other words does it serve a purpose in some way when you find yourself doing it yes this could well be an expression of anxiety or maybe some type of coping skill you have developed over the years to deal with stressful situations yet it sounds like you have developed a sort of kneejerk behavioral conditioning that causes you to do this behavior during specific or perhaps even nonspecific circumstances do you think it is a selfsoothing behavior do you feel good after you have done it the behavior itself is likely causing some form of slow physical damage so i would recommend you have yourself checked by a doctor to rule out any injury if none exists this obviously doesnt excuse the behavior it just says that for the moment luck is on your sidewhen we do any behavior of any kind it is good to ask if what we are doing has merit or value is the behavior helping us to solve our problem or is it merely creating yet another problem by doing the behavior in the first place in the same way that a person might drink excessively because they are stressed and need to cope with some unresolved issue when they are done drinking the original problem will still likely be there but now they are intoxicated no closer to solving the issue when we deal with things like anxiety or depression we need to do things that work on dealing with the symptoms but also get to the root issue that created those feelings and find effective solutions so the things we do to cope with life events need to not be ones that cause us harm but rather support us as we move forward and work to deal with what life throws at ussometimes seeking support from a friend or a counselor is a good idea being given the opportunity to express your feelings about what is going on around you and getting feedback and insight from others is much more effective than actions of selfharm wouldnt you agree so i would encourage you to find a counselor or a trusted friend who can help you find positive behaviors you can take to deal with your feelings as you also work to find the answers to the day to day issues of living a life filled with promise and opportunityreach out if you need helpthere will likely be a hand there waiting for you

i have several issues that i need to work through however i am afraid of and do not trust therapists after a horrible experience im dealing with grief and guilt over losing my sons due to drug use i have a very complicated traumatic relationship issue that is causing me severe anxiety and fear,i am sorry that you had this experience therapy should be a healthy positive experience off g growth you have the right to look for certain high qualities in a therapist and finding the right one each therapist is bound by a code of ethics and clients should have high expectations you are trusting them to guide support and help you achieve the absolute best outcome and success you should never be or feel judged and you should feel comfortable and feel as though your therapy process is moving along with your goals in mind speaking as a therapist i encourage my clients to always let me know how they feel even if they disagree with me they also have the right to inform me if something im doing simply is not working for them communication is critical in maintaining a healthy therapeutic alliance therapeutic relationship im able to offer ways of thinking and strategies to my clients they may not have thought of its important to listen to my clients its also critical for clients to feel they can share in a environment that feels safe non judgmental and confidentialremember you are the driver in your healing process you should be the one in control because you know what your life struggles are speaking as a therapist im here to guide my clients toward achieving their goals encouraging and empowering my clients in what is meaningful to them to achieve you should feel comfortable speaking your thoughts my advice would look one who open hearing toy feel even its regarding them a therapist that they are open to feedbackwith all of that being said it will take time to trust again but remember ask questions and communicate with the next therapist  share  your experience and how it made you feel and that trust and being spoken  in a respectful  non judgemental and non condnscending way is critical for you be honest clearly state your expectations from start  i offer free 50 minute first sessions for clients the reason i do this is because i feel that clients deserve opportunity observe the environment ask me questions and have the opportunity to determine their level of comfort and decide if its a good fit other therapists sometimes offer the similar try finding one willing to offer a  consultation as that could give you the opportunity to feel things out and set forth expectationsthe article below is an excellent article about what to look for in a therapist it is worth your time reading because you are worth finding the best help available this article was written based on both evidence from research and clinical experience i would strongly encourage anyone searching for help to read this and even use it as your guide i hope this was helpfulhttpswwwpsychologytodaycombloginsighttherapy20160310waysspotgoodtherapistlaura cassity lmsw lmac
why am i so afraid of it i dont understand,your fear is somewhat reasonable  no one wants to be raped and i imagine everyone is afraid of what being raped would feel likedo you mean that this fear is on your mind more often than you would likeif this is the case then try understanding the reason behind your fearis it because you personally know or know of someone who was raped  one general direction of what would help is to regain confidence in your decisions of keeping yourself safe  the more you trust yourself to avoid social situations with lots of drinking isolated physical surroundings and being in isolated locations with someone with whom youre not very familiar probably your fear will decreasethe other general direction to understand is if in your family history people have been violated severely either emotionally mentally or physicallyin families in which people have suffered severe violations of themselves often the emotional patterning of expecting to be hurt by others plants itself very deeply and transmits to the younger generationits possible then that you are suffering from fears established in other family members who have not yet been able to fully understand and accept their own sufferingthe good news is that individual therapy with a credentialed and licensed therapist is ideal for a safe place to open and clear this type of emotional burden
why am i so afraid of it i dont understand,why are you afraid of rape because it is a problem in the united states the national sexual violence resource center reports that one in five women 0r 20 will be raped httpwwwnsvrcorgsitesdefaultfilespublications_nsvrc_factsheet_mediapacket_statisticsaboutsexualviolence_0pdf and that 80 of women know their assailant given these statistics it is perfectly logical to be afraid however there are things you can do to reduce the risk of rape such as being aware of your surroundings and limiting the use of drugs or alcoholthe enhanced access knowledge act program for collegeaged women has been shown to reduce the risk of rape by more than 50 httpwwwblueprintsprogramscomfactsheeteaaaenhancedassessacknowledgeactsexualassaultresistanceeducation you may want to see if a program like this is available in your area another great app for when you need to walk somewhere alone is the companion app httpwwwcompanionappio friends or family can track your progress from one point to another via the gps in your phonein addition talking with a counselor about your fears would also be a good idea sometimes fears are rational and reasonable sometimes they are overreactions and unreasonable when then are overreactions and unreasonable they can have a negative impact on your life in this case a counselor could help you understand why your fears are unreasonable and how you can stop them from negatively impacting your life
i have attentiondeficithyperactivity disorder posttraumatic stress disorder anxiety anger and memory problems i cant work i have no income im on medicine but i feel worthless i want to be normal,i am so sorry to hear that you are struggling  it sounds like youve had a traumatic experience that has impacted your life in many ways  without knowing much about your history i wonder if the trauma you suffered has lead to the anxiety anger and memory problems you are dealing with in addition to ptsd  i would encourage you to look for a trauma therapist who offers a sliding scale or pro bono services  there may also be community mental health services in your area that offer free therapy if you are eligible for grant
i never feel like myself i cant even think straight anymore i start stuttering and i cant remember anything i always get nervous and usually talk myself down but recently end up fighting with what feels like someone else i dont know why i feel this way but i hate it,hi houston okay somethings definitely going on right my gut is to start with your family physician because you have some physical symptoms while it seems anxiety is a likely problem here your doctor will hopefully know your history and can help you decide if you need some medical tests or some therapy without knowing more thats all i can say at this point best of luck
i never feel like myself i cant even think straight anymore i start stuttering and i cant remember anything i always get nervous and usually talk myself down but recently end up fighting with what feels like someone else i dont know why i feel this way but i hate it,what you are describing sounds like it may be a form of dissociation dissociation is our minds way of disconnecting us from aspects of our experience in an attempt to protect us in overwhelming situations it also sounds like you are noticing anxiety in certain situations in working with a competent therapist you may be able to gain insight into these experiences learn skills for coping with anxiety and reconnecting with yourself and alleviate these symptoms over time
i never feel like myself i cant even think straight anymore i start stuttering and i cant remember anything i always get nervous and usually talk myself down but recently end up fighting with what feels like someone else i dont know why i feel this way but i hate it,helloi am wondering if you might be experiencing some form of dissociation  people who dissociate might feel like the world around them is unreal and unfamiliar or that they are not really in their bodies and that they are observing themselves from outside of their bodies  dissociation can also mean that there are parts of you that have split off and sometimes parts are can feel like they are at odds with each other or are locked in conflict  sometimes dissociation happens after someone experiences a trauma  therapy can help you to understand what is going on and help you to integrate your experiences and ultimately heali am a therapist in houston who specializes in dissociation  on my website i have information specific to dissociation that might be helpful to you sarah
i had to put a restraining order against my exfiancã he was served last night he was mentally and verbally abusive towards me i thought it was my nerves but every time i stand up i get sick if i sit and rock im fine,hello and thank you for your question you may be right your physical symptoms of getting sick to your stomach may very well be your nerves or anxiety that is totally normal and understandable given your circumstances another thing that is not unusual is that you feel better when you sit and rock that is actually a fairly common way that many people comfort themselves in times of high stress if you are concerned that there is an actual physical illness causing these symptoms you may want to visit your primary care provider they may tell you that they dont see anything physically wrong with you and at that point you may want to visit a counselor about the symptoms and your relationship experience a visit with a counselor may be a good idea either way i work as a counselor in primary care and i promise you that many people have very real physical symptoms when they have gone through abuse unexplainable stomach and headaches are very common sometimes with counseling those physical symptoms actually stop be well and i hope you feel better soonrobin j landwehr dbh lpcc ncc

ive been on 05 mg of xanax twice a day for the past month it hasnt been helping me at all but when i take 1 mg during a big anxiety attack it calms me down i was wondering how i can ask my psychologist to up the dose to 1 mg twice a day without her thinking im abusing them i just have very big anxiety attacks should i stay on the 05mg and deal with the attacks or should i ask to up the dose im afraid she will take me off them and put me on something else,do you think youre abusing xanaxit is a highly addictive drug so maybe one reason you feel compelled to take more is bc you already are addicteddrugs dont do anything helpful in solving lifes problems  once the effect wears off the stressful situation is once again waiting for you to address itthink over your reason for not directly asking your psychologist about upping your dosealso do you ever talk about your life problems with this psychologist or only your need for drugs   the more gradual path to a better life is to not need drugs in the first place this consists of your willingness to face the matters that are creating such terrible feelings inside you

its especially bad at night time i am scared of sleeping alone,being able to know you feel anxiety and write about it is the first step to addressing and handling itgenerally anxiety is deep fear of not being able to handle what comes up in life  somehow the person was insufficiently nurtured and so felt  insecure when very youngusually the person had to fend on at least a psychological and emotional level for themselves before reaching an age when doing so would have been reasonabletheir inner feeling of overwhelmed from when very young hasnt faced the reality that the grown person is now capable even if this takes some practice try asking yourself what you are afraid of and theorize how you would handle these situations as a grown personalso sometimes anxiety comes from feeling lonely  this loneliness is reminiscent of the loneliness that the grown person now felt when being left to take care of situations as a child which were too difficult and complex for any child to address
i am on the track and softball team my school is small so i play all four sports it offers i feel obligated to do track because im not a horrible runner and my dad wants me to the catch is is that the days before a track meet and the morning of i get sick and cry,does anyone notice that you get sick and cry on track meet dayshave you told anyonefrom what you write as much as you would like to please your school and dad something within you doesnt quite want to fully follow throughstep one in life always is to know what you want and what your limits are  it already is difficult to avoid listening to your bodytry understanding what is difficult in telling your father that youd like doing as he wishes only are not able to do so because you are emotionally and physically distraught on the days you have trackafter finishing the season for this year with your schools track team then expect to concentrate on taking care of your own need to not do trackhopefully your father will understand and care about your problem  if he does not and track is more important than your well being then you have a different problem entirely
i am on the track and softball team my school is small so i play all four sports it offers i feel obligated to do track because im not a horrible runner and my dad wants me to the catch is is that the days before a track meet and the morning of i get sick and cry,it sounds like you are no longer committed to track emotionally  it can be hard to talk to your dad about this but he may think you love track and may not know you are getting so upset the days of meets  an idea would be to first write a letter to your dad to see what feelings come out and then preparing to speak with him  i think he will appreciate your honesty and maybe this conversation will bring you relief and also time to find something you really will enjoy
im socially awkward ive always want to be popular ive had the opportunity to be popular but every time i get it im too scared all i have to do is talk the popular people theyre really nice to me but im too scared of change i really want to work up the courage to lose my fear,change can be uncomfortable but sometimes those uncomfortable moments are the opportunity for us to be the person we feel we really are  it sounds like you like to spend the time in your head anticipating the worst why not be in the present and encourage yourself that you can talk to people and it will be okay  by telling yourself it will not be okay or that it will go wrong you are hurting your confidence to do what you want  give yourself some credit for being awesome and tell yourself you can build new friendshipsit may be the motivation you need to move past this fear
i often get the feeling that im being watched like video cameras are hidden wherever i am even at home i feel like people can see all that i do and are reading my thoughts things i read or hear on the radio seem to be about or meant for me and people are talking about me when they whisper,it sounds like you are feeling pretty overwhelmed with worry about being continuously monitored with no privacy even in your own mind and as if people are constantly saying things about you in whispers on in the media its hard to say from a post online what is at the root of this experience but you may be able to get insight into that as well as develop ways of coping with the distress of feeling this way with the help of a good therapist there is no pill or technique that can guarantee that this experience will go away though it might however there are things that you can do so that you can understand it better and so that it does not have such an impact on your ability to lead a satisfy life
i have a bad habit of thinking and worrying about what others may think of me i really want to stop it and enjoy things,thinking about what others think of us is a natural tendency human beings are social creatures and rely on feedback from the outside world of people places and things to let us know more about ourselves we also have an inner voice dialogue conscience etc that helps us to determine the path for us often when someone is worried about the external feedback and focuses on this as the sole source of information it can create a dependency that can become problematic balance is key to so many things in life your own voice is powerful and has strength to provide you the enjoyment you seek dont discount it and rely only on the voices of others
i feel really uncomfortable when i have peoples attention it makes me not want to talk in public or answer questions in class can i get over this social anxiety,you can learn lots of skillstechniques to feel more confident in what you need to do that will decrease your anxious response for sure  and you can also learn how to work with your personality that may not like the attention you may find that talking to others through the internet is more comfortable and you are great at it or that you love one on one talking but arent really made for group talking there is a place in this world for you either way public speaking skills can be practiced in speech class or toastmaster group they will give you practice in a safe environment where the cool kids or cutest boy arent ready to laugh at you what topics are you interested in and what groups can you do a little speaking up maybe in your small group at church try and raise you hand to share your opinion or maybe your girl scout troop look around for a peer and one adult who you like to hear speak out ask them to share with you 2 things that help them feel comfortable speaking in public check out some ted talks and see how they share in groups social anxiety is a difficult concern and picking apart what is your awesome personality and what needs skill building and mindfulnessanxiety help are important steps good luck
i feel really uncomfortable when i have peoples attention it makes me not want to talk in public or answer questions in class can i get over this social anxiety,since anxiety usually about anticipating a bad result or fear of being judged negatively as though having failed some sort of test consider what would give you the feeling of anticipating a good result from talking to an audiencemaybe for example if you prepared and rehearsed your talk more than what you typically would youd feel more secure in speaking  in front of an audienceonce you sort through your particular reason as to the source of your discomfort it may feel more manageableyes social anxiety can change  you may naturally prefer smaller groups than an audienceand it is possible to decrease anxiety in what may always be somewhat uncomfortable for you
i have been having a lot of nightmares where i am being killed in different ways i either wake up in a panic or just crying and sweating it has made me terrified of falling asleep and is now affecting my daily life too can i make the nightmares stop,hello and thank you for your question sleep problems including insomnia and even the nightmares that you are writing about are really common for people and so many people suffer from them here are a few things to consider or to try 1 have you changed or started taking any new medication lately medications can certainly affect your sleep and some can even cause vivid or frightening dreams if you are taking a new medication talk to your provider about the nightmares this may be the cause 2 stress can certainly increase our difficulty with sleep and can also begin to affect our dream states the dreams may not make much sense but then again even good dreams dont always make much sense ask yourself do i have any new or renewed stressors in my life work school relationships health all of these areas and many more are places where stress can hide out if this is the case talk with your provider or consider seeing a counselor who may be able to help 3 something to consider is that once we start to have anxiety or stress about something we can begin to obsess about it my guess is that going to bed for sleep is no longer a pleasant thing for you your stress and fear of what may happen when you sleep could start way before you actually go to bed this could increase your chances of having another bad dream try relaxation techniques before going to bed if you have youtube you can pull up guided meditation for sleep exercises to help you relax there are many different ones to choose from you may also want to try deep breathing4 there are selfhelp ideas for managing bad nightmares if you google search nightmare rescripting or nightmare exposure you may find some ideas and instructions on how to manage dreams i hope these ideas help be well robin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
my boyfriend and i have been dating for almost a year we go to different schools and we dont see each other that often i just feel very paranoid that theres someone else or that he could be hiding something from me,have you spoken to him about your fears perhaps you can explain this feeling to him and let him know what might lead to feeling more secure  also it is important to trust your intuition  perhaps there are good reasons to feel concerned it may not be paranoia  it may be based in reality
my boyfriend and i have been dating for almost a year we go to different schools and we dont see each other that often i just feel very paranoid that theres someone else or that he could be hiding something from me,paranoid is a mental disorder word that is a strong word i think to use in this situation honestly the bottom like is either you dont trust him for some reason or you are insecure with yourself which is it do some soul searching to help you figure which one it is  work on either discussing why you dont trust him and work on building that trust or why you feel you are not good enough and work on that
im concerned about my boyfriend i suffer from anxiety but i always have this feeling he wants to hurt me because he told me he was interested in bdsm intercourse we havent tried it but ive had this feeling he always wants to,hello thank you for your question there are few things that people find more personal than their sexual relationships when we feel connected to our partner sex can be best thing since sliced bread however if we feel disconnected in some way sex can feel degrading and even painful i dont know the specifics about your relationship or how comfortable you are in talking to your boyfriend but this is one of those situations where communicating your fears is a good idea the only exception to that would be if you believe he is actually a threat to you in some way if you believe that then you should do whatever you think is safe it sounds like there is a part of you that is already afraid of him and if that is the case then remaining safe is your top priority assuming you are able to share with him your feelings telling him what you are and are not interested in sexually is very appropriate and sexually healthy sex is something that is supposed to be enjoyable for all parties all parties should feel respected and able to say œno to absolutely anything they are not comfortable with i call the respectful agreement between sexual partners œsex trust sex trust means your partner respects your boundaries it means they wont degrade you sexually with hurtful words forced sex or forcing or coercing sex in ways someone is not interested in having  your personal safety and mental wellbeing is what is most important now if there is a part of you that is curious about bdsm and may be interested in participating in it there are many websites that you can explore to learn information i will warn you some websites and articles are better or worse than others but you may at least feel more informed many people engage in bdsm and have happy relationships but again it completely depends on what each person in the relationship wants it is also important to know that bdsm is not just one thing and people practice it differently based on comfort if it is something you are uncomfortable with then you shouldnt feel obligated to do it  i hope this was helpful be well  robin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
i get so much anxiety and i dont know why i feel like i cant do anything by myself because im scared of the outcomes,this is a very common question in my practice panic attacks typically emerge from an underlying issue ex depression low selfesteem fears to decrease your anxiety symptoms its recommended to seek treatment with a therapist who specializes in working with anxiety disorders and most importantly one with whom you feel comfortable within my practice i educate clients about their anxiety and discuss building a framework with helpful tools for decreasing anxiety1 starting a daily mindfulness practice for example listening to guided meditation engaging in deep breathing exercises yoga practice or other positive calming activities2 understand your negative and positive thoughts many times we tend to focus on the potential for bad things to happen increase positive selftalk when feeling down or when anxious for example i dont need to worry i am calm and relaxed 3 exposure to fearful or anxious situations this can be accomplished under the care of a mental health professional many times we shy away from things that make us feel uncomfortable or insecure this may led to an increase in isolating behaviors resulting in difficulty in performing things we were once able to do for example leaving the house presenting in front of others going to social events and having conversations with people however the more we expose ourselves and practice the use of our positive coping skills ex deep breathing the chances of anxiety will decrease i hope this was helpful keep in mind a therapist can help with guiding you through self relaxation and improvement
i get so much anxiety and i dont know why i feel like i cant do anything by myself because im scared of the outcomes,the other two post answers to your question are very good and i dont feel the need to repeat what has already been said quite well but i will offer one other option i have been able to utilize quite successfully with those dealing with panic attacks  chain analysis is a fantastic way for your to map out the situation starting with the prompting event the chain of events links that lead up to the behavior  in this case a panic attack and then what the consequences were  see the illustration belowthis is very useful in that it lays everything out for you to see so that it becomes possible to alter one of the links leading up to the unwanted behavior panic attack allows you to come up with strategies for similar situations prompting events and allows you to understand how you are reinforcing the behavior when it does occur consequences  finally  it would also allow you to identify any particular vulnerabilities such as not enough sleep poor nutrition trauma history or having a cold the time it occurred  working with someone who utilizes a behavioral approach such as dbt or behavioral analysis you can find solutions that replace one of the links and therefore breaks the chain of events
i get so much anxiety and i dont know why i feel like i cant do anything by myself because im scared of the outcomes,anxiety is simply your system communicating to you that you are in danger the issue that i see in most of my clients is that they try to reason with this anxiety you do not reason with sensory states in the body if your system tells your in danger your stomache feels like it is knots your heart is beating out of your chest validate by just being present with it take your breath to it breath in and out of that space say ok i am in danger i always tell my clients a crying baby wants to be held not told to shut up listen to your system validate it like you do a child and see what happens
i get so much anxiety and i dont know why i feel like i cant do anything by myself because im scared of the outcomes,the are two ways that such anxiety can be dealt with one is an attempt to replace maladaptive thinking by examining the distorted thinking and resetting the fightorflight response with more reasonable accurate ones as an example im scared of spiders but if you change the thinking from being scared to im bigger than the spider it allows the mind to reach a calmer state of mind mindfulnessbased therapy can also help  focus on the bodily sensations that arise when you feel anxious instead of avoiding or withdrawing from these feelings remain present and fully experience the symptoms of anxiety instead of avoiding distressing thoughts open up to them in an effort to realize and acknowledge that they are not literally truealthough it may seem counterintuitive fully realizing the experience of anxiety enables the release of over identification with negative thoughts you can practice responding to disruptive thoughts and letting these thoughts goby remaining present in the body youll learn that the anxiety being experienced is merely a reaction to perceived threats by positively responding to threatening events instead of being reactive you can overcome an erroneous fightorflight response
i started dating my fiancã two years ago my first cousin is married to my fiancãs sister there has always been a communication issue between my uncle and aunt and my cousin and his wife my uncle goes to my mom instead of talking to my cousin and it upsets my mom,based on the information provided this is an issue with boundaries  sounds like your uncle goes to your mom and possibly your mother takes the issues to you i do not like to assume so i will direct you to information regarding families dealing with enmeshment and triangulation enmeshment is the concept of diffused boundaries in families and other personal relationships triangulation is two individuals relaying information to a third party what cannot be said directly to each other  from someone who has dealt with both these issues on a personal level being informed about family dynamics is beneficial and can help you develop healthy boundaries for yourself within your family structure you may need assistance with developing healthy boundaries although it is possible it is not easy to change the way you have been operating for any extended amount of time hope this help
i started dating my fiancã two years ago my first cousin is married to my fiancãs sister there has always been a communication issue between my uncle and aunt and my cousin and his wife my uncle goes to my mom instead of talking to my cousin and it upsets my mom,when youre upset about something the first question you can ask yourself is whose problem is this it is amazing how many problems will disappear right at that point because you realize the problem isnt even yours you cant fix everything in your family you are starting a new family of your own and its time to create a protective bubble around your family unit that keeps other peoples issues away i tell myself not my pig not my farm not my problem when you stop trying to take care of other peoples problems they are more likely to step up and deal with it themselves 
whenever i have to speak in public or be in big crowds i freak out i get lightheaded sweaty and i have trouble breathing,basically your response is the fight flight or freeze reaction which is hard wired into the human nervous system specifically the autonomic nervous system called the autonomic response this system is responsible for regulating the heart digestion respiratory rate as well as other aspects which match the symptoms you describe it is largely an unconscious function but with training it can be managed such as a public speaking course in which you prepare and even have some exposure to smaller experiences to help you prepare and cope for larger presentations one of the greatest applications of addressing this response is the nasa program which exposes the astronauts to situations they will encounter while in space which will trigger the response so that when it does happen not if but when that they are able to move through the challenge with success you can learn more about his by going to ted talks œwhat i learned about going blind in space it is a truly inspiring look at what you are experiencing as well as how to deal with it with that being said finding a program like a dale carnegie public speaking program can help working with a counselor who can help you utilize visualization of an upcoming speech has been shown to help and you can always talk to your doctor to see what options might be available there as well good luck
whenever i have to speak in public or be in big crowds i freak out i get lightheaded sweaty and i have trouble breathing,as you do it more it should get better or at less with less anxiety anxiety is normal for most when speaking in public i hear this from even the best of facilitators who have been doing it for years i even experienced that when i first became a counselor and had to lead classes i asked myself why were i so anxious i admit at that time i didnt have confidence in myself the more i prepared and practiced the more my confidence level increased yours will too
i am a teenage girl ive been seeing the same dream once in a while since i was very young the problem is that i dont remember anything about this dream i still know that its the same one and then i wake up in a panic and i cry really loud without knowing the reason why do i see the same dream why can i not remember it and what should i do to remember it,there is no scientifically established formula for understanding dreams that i know about however many people get a great deal of value from exploring what their dreams mean it is believed by many that our dreams contain metaphors that represent meaningful patterns in our lives and relationships and if we pay attention to them we can learn important things about ourselves one thing you might try to see if you can get more insight into the dream and possibly begin remembering things is to take note of whatever you do remember any details about your experience such as when do you wake up from the dream how do you feel both emotionally and physically what are you thinking about when you wake up is there any pattern in terms of what happens to you in your waking life around the time you have this dream if you can keep a journal or a recording device to speak into by your bed you can try to record whatever you do remember and notice as soon as you wake up people seem to have more difficulty remembering dreams the more time they let go by before attempting to record the dream or if you go back to sleep before recording what you remember
ive been with my boyfriend for a year and a half he loves me a lot and i love him it hurts to be apart from him for so long it hurts all over and then i feel like it wont last,i would suggest that you look up the word codependency and its characteristics  see if you relate to those characteristics  i have a feeling  you have suffered some form of loss in your life that you have not dealt with properly  for some reason you are depending on your boyfriend to fill that loss  considering working with a counseling to work through your emotions and resolve any lingering issues
i started seeing this guy that i met at a mutual friends place he recently broke up with his exgirlfriend and started seeing me everything was great in the beginning then i started having low selfesteem thoughts and thinking he was hanging with his exgirlfriend again its all i think about i am still seeing him but things have changed because i am at a loss for words i get stuck in my own thoughts i like and care for him a lot he just makes me nervous and gives me the butterflies,sounds like you are struggling with your own negative thoughts  as you stated everything was great then you started having low selfesteem thoughts and thinking  what is contributing to these negative thoughts  his actions or your past experiences with unhealthy relationships would be my question
i have not had a friend since i was 19 i dont go anywhere and i have no job all because im afraid of people,individual andor group therapy can be a powerful antidote for social anxiety often in therapy the things that tend to get in the way of our securing satisfying and lasting personal relationships will appear in some way in the therapy relationship and a competent therapist will be able to help you work through this anxiety in a sensitive way and eventually encourage you to seek out the personal relationships that you want in group therapy you have an opportunity to have a relationship not only with the therapist but several other people who are all in the group in order to give and receive mutual support to one another
i feel insecure in my life i dont think my wife truly wants our relationship even though she says she does i have turned to drinking to help relieve my repressed stress about this and other issues i have had a drinking problem for a few years i feel the reason i drink is not just because i like to but because i have lately been on edge ive been very oddly emotional when watching movies that i have been watching for years im paranoid about driving on main roads im very jumpy at the slightest noises,given the description you have posted here it may be time to find someone to work with  first and foremost look into working with someone who specializes in working with individuals with challenges surrounding drinking this would need to be assessed first since if it has been ongoing it may be making the situation worse and given the time it has been utilized as a coping mechanism there is reason to believe that the structure of your brain may have been effected as has been demonstrated by current neurological research  there are however ways to address this  as for coping mechanisms the person you work with should also look at offering you alternatives such as the skills found within the dialectic behavior therapy model dbt which has several useful tools to help address the underlying anxiety and difficulty managing emotional regulation  mindfulness another component of dbt should also prove to be useful in both becoming aware of your state of mind and emotional state to allow you to make different choices which has been supported by a growing body of evidence  there are also other tools designed to help repair damaged relationships  well worth looking intoseeking help is never easy and it is only human to be hesitant given some of the cultural views of working with therapist  this is a difficult place to be in and one that is not easy to move out of but sitting on it is not going to help it go away  think of it this way if you broke your arm would you just wrap it up and hope for the best or seek out a professional to help you set the break and teach you how to mend the wound  the same applies here  think of it as first aid for the mind
i feel insecure in my life i dont think my wife truly wants our relationship even though she says she does i have turned to drinking to help relieve my repressed stress about this and other issues i have had a drinking problem for a few years i feel the reason i drink is not just because i like to but because i have lately been on edge ive been very oddly emotional when watching movies that i have been watching for years im paranoid about driving on main roads im very jumpy at the slightest noises,sorry hearing about the big amount of stress which you are feeling at this timesince a lot of your stress is directed to uncertainty of whether your wife is happy being with you would you consider continuing the conversation with her about your understanding of her answer to youyour observation that she says one thing and behaves in a different way is meaningfulbringing your point to her attention would at the very least demonstrate her interest in showing and explaining her viewpoint about youbasically youd be expecting her to care about you and how she handles herself with this question may clarify what youre trying to find outthe good news about your relationship with alcohol is that you realize youre overdoing itfrom what you write the emotional pain and helplessness you feel currently seem too much to know about all at onceone possibility is to accept your feelings of hurt and insecurity  this is the first step of working with them  if they start feeling overwhelming then maybe too you can distract yourself for a while from the intensity by engaging in an activity that is not selfharmingafter all you are the most important person in your life so keep yourself safe and healthy
i think im annoying and bothersome but my girlfriend says im just fine i dont think so i think im stressing everyone else out,i think you have identified something important here its not unusual to experience feelings that dont seem to match up with what your rational mind recognizes in this case it sounds like a part of you recognizes that the people around you do not find you annoying and bothersome despite knowing that people like you it seems that theres still a part of you that feels like youre a botherfinding a local counselor who can work with you to process those feelings might be just the help you need

i think im annoying and bothersome but my girlfriend says im just fine i dont think so i think im stressing everyone else out,im glad to hear you have friends and that your friends say they like youtrust your own sense of who you are which tells you that something feels uneasy within yourselfis the friend who says youre just fine very familiar with who you arefriend is a broad categoryshe may not know you as fully as you know yourselfbasically it is possible to be fine and have some inner stressfollow your own thoughts and observations to more fully learn about yourself in ways your friend may not notice or be aware
i think im annoying and bothersome but my girlfriend says im just fine i dont think so i think im stressing everyone else out,interesting  how much of your issue is your own selfjudging and how much of your perception is realthere are many ways to stop judging and selfjudging using cognitive theory cbt  you could find a cbt counselor therapist to help you reduce your judgments  in addition ive written extensively about this in my book living yes a handbook for being human wwwlivingyesorg  i recommend you visit the webpage and pick up a copyas to your own perception  you seem okay being who you are and your girlfriend agrees  instead you appear to be upset by your own guess at what others may be thinking thats a trap that stresses a lot of folks out  consider this  many happy people dont mind what others think of them  and consider this  many heroic characters in literature and movies are unlikeable  colombo is annoying and bothersome but we love him  so is johnnys depps jack sparrow and many of the roles played by george clooney sandra bullock and jack nicholson  would it be okay with you to be an antihero in your own life  if you dont want to be an antihero you have the power to be the person you want  your behaviors and thoughts are completely under your control  what other people think of you is not under your control  you are completely in the drivers seat here  the choices are all yours  enjoy who you are and use your will power to make yourself who you want to be  mark  wwwmarkmorrislcswcom and wwwlivingyesorg
im a little paranoid my mind does get the best of me one night i put chairs under all of my door knobs because i thought someone might break in i also think a lot which is probably the reason for the paranoia i cant stand loud noises like the sound of cars going by the grocery store is too noisy and i feel like people are looking at me,paranoid people dont realize they are paranoid  they believe their actions to be reasonable responses to potential threatsfrom what you write you are aware that your actions may be understood as extremeinstead of trying to fit your behavior into a negative psychological category try seeing each of the behaviors you list here as your own uniquenessthis way you will become more tolerant of what very well be your natural tendenciesif you are someone who needs a lot of time in quiet then not liking loud noises doesnt make you paranoid it is simply the way of who you areone possible way of feeling better is if you would accept the answers youve developed so far for yourself  they may be a little unusual compared to what we consider mainstream  from what you describe you already are dealing with what you call paranoia
when i go to school i feel like everyone is judging me even my friends i get overwhelmed which these thoughts and sometimes cannot get out of what i call a deep hole of thoughts i barely go to any of our school dances because of all of the people not even when i am completely alone do these thoughts go away i still feel like people can see me and are judging me,it sounds like a couple of things are going on here you are noticing yourself feeling judged by the people around you and that you are avoiding social activities and in addition to this you have intrusive thoughts that you are being judged even when alone it sounds like these thoughts are pretty distressing and you are wondering what is happening to you many people who come to therapy experience intrusive and distressing thoughts of various kinds which often influence their behavior in ways that they may not like such as leading them to isolate in therapy you may be able to gain insight into the nature of your distress as well as learn ways to cope and eventually alleviate this distress so that you can have satisfaction and security in your life and relationships
recently i had a close call after delivering my second child blood clot followed by internal bleeding and several blood transfusions it was a close call i am currently undergoing medical treatment because of the event and i am constantly afraid the whole ordeal will happen again i have never really had anxiety in the past but i find now that it consumes my every day and night with two beautiful children to raise i am most terrified of not being able to raise and protect them,hi meriden its natural that after a serious scare like that you would have some anxiety and fear this fear is helpful to some extent because it will assist you in taking care of yourself and not taking unnecessary risks with your health you can say thanks very much to fear for trying to protect you and then you can take steps to reduce it right now fear is working overtime and stealing your quality of life you can work to put it into perspectivei invite you to imagine that your job is to convince fear that you dont need it screaming in your ear constantly in order to be as safe as you can be imagine that fear is in front of you its saying hey you need me if i wasnt keeping you alert you would be very ill fear doesnt trust you to take care of yourself what is the evidence you are caring for yourself and doing everything you can to prevent a recurrence what is the evidence that this wont likely happen again it was specifically connected to the stress of labour right what is the evidence from your doctor that this is unlikely to recur what is the evidence that you are healing what is the evidence that you are very aware of the danger and will respond quickly if there is a recurrence what is the evidence that worrying about it will hurt you not help you how many hours of your life do you want to hand over to fearfear is trying to keep you safe but you can turn the volume down by talking to yourself about all these things i wish you well
i constantly have this urge to throw away all my stuff its constantly on my mind and makes me feel anxious i dont sleep because im thinking about something i can get rid of i dont know why i do it i started years ago when i lived with my dad then i stopped when i moved in with my mom years later it has started again,since you wrote that you noticed a change in your throwing away urge when you changed with which parent you lived would you feel that throwing away things is connected to wanting to be done with certain areas of influence with either parentplay in your mind with the metaphor of throwing away and whatever associations you feel toward this  are you feeling alarmed or freed by throwing away things  im only suggesting these not telling you that they apply necessarilyanxiety comes up when people feel helpless to manage a meaningful part of their lives  so pay attention whether your stuff represents difficult scenarios or phases of your growing up years  possibly you are trying to rid yourself of painful feelings which were part of your early years relationship with either parentbasically sounds as though you are trying to establish a clearer sense of who you are and the throwing away part is a means of discovering who you are once all the clutter is released
i met a guy a while ago and i cant stop thinking about him i feel like i love him but i dont think i know him what if he is not who i think he is i cry sometimes thinking someone is going to be with him or that he has a girlfriend i dont know am i too obsessive every time we talk though its like magic he makes me feel amazing but what if im mistaken,keller it sounds like youre living this relationship in your mind instead of in the real world you can get answers to your questions by talking to himgetting to know him will answer all the curiosities you have youre asking the questions in your head instead of being in the friendship so what is it that gets in the way of actually asking the questions and getting to know him fear of rejection fear of something else if you have fear that keeps you from having fulfilling friendships i recommend a therapist to help you work through that i wish you well 
ive been experiencing a lot of anxiety and panic attacks lately i was recently diagnosed by my psychiatrist with obsessivecompulsive disorder lately ive been questioning everything from my career to my relationship my boyfriend and i just moved in a few months ago all of a sudden i dont feel as comfortable around him as i used to although i cant seem to find a reason as to why i feel this way,how is your boyfriend responding to your discomfort around himhas he told you that hes noticed changes in youthe good news about a relationship is that you can talk about matters with the other person  doing so can only help clarify feelings and what either of you expect from the relationship  given that the two of you recently moved in together it is natural for new dynamics feelings and expectations to arise  it just adds to the reasonableness of talking with each other about how living together feels to each of youpsychiatrists earn their living by diagnosing people and telling them to take pills  very often just being told the person has a condition makes them feel fragile and less capable than they actually areanxiety and panic attacks do mean that there is a great deal of emotion and situation needing to be addressedit is the normal sign of having to address many or deep matters   be patient and give yourself time to learn the details of your relationship and whatever the career particulars are that are bothering you  youre apparently selfaware since youre the one describing your own problematic situations  keep the label of being disordered aside  psychiatry labels do more good for psychiatrists than they do for people who are trying to live their lives
ive been experiencing a lot of anxiety and panic attacks lately i was recently diagnosed by my psychiatrist with obsessivecompulsive disorder lately ive been questioning everything from my career to my relationship my boyfriend and i just moved in a few months ago all of a sudden i dont feel as comfortable around him as i used to although i cant seem to find a reason as to why i feel this way,hi new jerseyyou talk about two very big changes in your life that have happened lately the diagnosisanxiety and the moving in together thats a loti love how you recognise that you been questioning everything i think anxietys got its toe in the door and its pushing you around wanting some power over you fear and anxiety try to convince us that we need protection and that its best to either pull away or fight but letting anxiety control how you see your relationship isnt the answer here i think you know that alreadyyou must have moved in with him for a reason and its appropriate now to simply trust that to ask him for some patience and to focus on learning to manage the anxiety rather than questioning this decision to move in fear is getting in the way of you trusting yourself and your decision you can figure the anxiety piece out while living with your boyfriendwhen youre in a bit of a crisis is not the right time to make a major change i suggest you use a therapist who works with cognitive behavioural therapy to learn to manage the anxiety and then the relationship will likely seem more clear

i have lately been having lots of anxiety and selfloathing about the fact that i am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before it seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore and i just had my first kiss five months ago im worried that at this rate i wont have a boyfriend for a very long time the problem is that i want to lose my virginity to my first boyfriend who cares about me but at the same time i dont want to be waiting forever in order to experience sex i have already given in to bad temptations by hooking up with random strangers on social media sites and having oral sex with them luckily they were nice guys but none of them wanted a relationship with me i feel dirty by doing this but i feel pressured to do this things in order to seem normal most people are surprised when they find out that i am a virgin or never had a boyfriend because people think i am really good looking i am tall i play lots of sports and i get excellent grades in school i am in my first year of university right now and no guys have approached me to go out on a date or showed any interest it bothers me most of the people in my family have been in relationships at my age already i feel like i will be single forever sometimes,hi winters im so glad you wrote because i think there are a lot of young women experiencing the exact same thing you feel selfloathing for both being a virgin and for being sexually active young women have always gotten crazy mixed messages about what theyre supposed to be they feel pressure to be pure and they also feel pressure to be the vixen and please men sexually but you cant be both so you cant ever win if you buy into all that horse manure excuse my language this current hookup culture puts added pressure on girls to expect nothing more than random sexual encounters that leave you feeling empty and used perhaps desirable in that moment but mostly worthless the stupid part is that research tells us that young men are also impacted negatively by this cultural norm that values sex and not relationship they feel guilt and loneliness  i urge you to talk to other girls and women about your feelings my hope and prayer is that they will echo my words hereyour value and power cannot ever be found in whether a man wants you whether you turn his eye or how he treats you your sexuality is a beautiful part of who you are and it is to be celebrated i love that you want to celebrate it with someone who cares who you are is so very much more than your sexuality you sound like you have a lot of things going for you try to see all of those things when you think of yourselfthere are many more virgins out there and many are afraid like you that they dont fit in we are all different and you dont have to be anything but who you want to be who you are you dont have to have any kind of sex until youre ready and that makes you brave and smart not weirdyoure tall and beautiful and guys may be intimidated by that it may take time for you to meet the right guy but hes out there the question is how do you want to spend your time until he crosses your path i hope you talk to someone soon and find out that your feelings are normal i wish you the best
i have lately been having lots of anxiety and selfloathing about the fact that i am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before it seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore and i just had my first kiss five months ago im worried that at this rate i wont have a boyfriend for a very long time the problem is that i want to lose my virginity to my first boyfriend who cares about me but at the same time i dont want to be waiting forever in order to experience sex i have already given in to bad temptations by hooking up with random strangers on social media sites and having oral sex with them luckily they were nice guys but none of them wanted a relationship with me i feel dirty by doing this but i feel pressured to do this things in order to seem normal most people are surprised when they find out that i am a virgin or never had a boyfriend because people think i am really good looking i am tall i play lots of sports and i get excellent grades in school i am in my first year of university right now and no guys have approached me to go out on a date or showed any interest it bothers me most of the people in my family have been in relationships at my age already i feel like i will be single forever sometimes,i think that every person who has been single for any extended period of time has felt the same worries  myself included since relationships are so important to us we fear not having them and being single it is similar to fearing that we wont ever get a good job when we have been out of work for awhile or fearing that we wont be healthy when we have been sick we fear these things because they are so important  not because these fears are realistic or true there is immense pressure put on young single people from peers and media to conform to ideas of what is normal and to meet expectations in terms of sexual experience dating etc while some people may judge an adult who is a virgin  others will respect your choices and feel even more attracted to you because of your choices experimenting with sex so long as you are being safe and respectful is also completely okay and normal since expectations vary and we cant be happy if we are always comparing ourselves to other people we need to ultimately trust that being who we are and building a loving relationship with ourselves is the key to meeting someone who will cherish us for all the ways that we are special and unique virgin or not when we are able to really accept ourselves and trust in our loveableness not a real word but you get what i mean then meeting someone special is simply a matter of time and effort  putting ourselves out in the world in situations where we are likely to meet other single people looking for relationships when you are most afraid of being alone  remember that this fear is simply a reminder of how much you value relationships use that passion about wanting relationships to build the best relationship you can with yourself and then one day soon some lucky person will stumble into your life and benefit immensely from your passion and your ability to be authentically who you are rather than pretending to be normal or whatever that is anyway hope this helps

i have lately been having lots of anxiety and selfloathing about the fact that i am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before it seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore and i just had my first kiss five months ago im worried that at this rate i wont have a boyfriend for a very long time the problem is that i want to lose my virginity to my first boyfriend who cares about me but at the same time i dont want to be waiting forever in order to experience sex i have already given in to bad temptations by hooking up with random strangers on social media sites and having oral sex with them luckily they were nice guys but none of them wanted a relationship with me i feel dirty by doing this but i feel pressured to do this things in order to seem normal most people are surprised when they find out that i am a virgin or never had a boyfriend because people think i am really good looking i am tall i play lots of sports and i get excellent grades in school i am in my first year of university right now and no guys have approached me to go out on a date or showed any interest it bothers me most of the people in my family have been in relationships at my age already i feel like i will be single forever sometimes,i think one of the first questions that springs to mind for me is whats the rush  just because other people in your circle have had experiences that you are still warming up to does not mean that theres something wrong or something to be ashamed of  if anything i want to commend you on the selfrespect you have in wanting to wait and share this most intimate of experiences with someone that will feel the same way about it  one of the most common distortions in our thinking is when we try to directly compare ourselves to others while these people and even those in your family share a level of closeness to you they are not exactly like you  they dont see or feel things in the exact same way as you nor do they share the exact same perspective its important to be making choices for you and for your own desires and life goals  once you stop comparing your happiness you may find that you are already experiencing it and allow more of your guard to fall down
for my whole life ive been very unconfident insecure and selfquestioning im super quiet because im scared of what people will think of me i avoid all social situations as it causes me great anxiety it is how both of my parents have always been and i feel like im doomed to that life also it makes it super hard for me at work as the other employees try to use me and walk all over me because im too nice it causes me depression and brings me down im in my early twenties and i really need to create a better life for myself ive been like this for so long so how do i change,one of the greatest ways that we can promote ourselves s by learning how to assert ourselves  despite what most people think of when they hear the word assertive assertive communication is one of the best ways to manage interpersonal conflict as well as maintain personal boundaries  once we become comfortable with acknowledging our boundaries there is usually a followup whereby we realize that we have the right to those boundaries  in effect assertiveness communication becomes its own selfmotivating force in managing positive selfesteem you may want to invest in a workbook that can help you to develop these skills on your own or work directly with a therapist to develop them in a safe situation  one of the workbooks that i have found to be very helpful is the assertiveness workbook how to express your ideas and stand up for yourself at work and in relationships by randy j paterson

i feel that i need to end my present relationship he lives three hours away and likes the reassurance of having someone to talk to multiple times per day and seeing me once or twice a month i want someone who is more present and more of a life companion lately he has had a very busy work schedule and i have only seen him a few times in the last 6 weeks i told him that i cant continue in this way because i constantly feel frustrated and angry and that he is not making the relationship enough of a priority i also feel it is keeping me from possibly finding the relationship i want we have been together 7 years the problem is that i panic and experience anxiety and depression thinking of him with someone else and then thinking i will never meet someone i like we have gone through this cycle already 45 times and i feel it is unhealthy to stay in it but my aversion to the anxiety and depression i experience upon separation always leads me to reconcile,it sounds like you have some insight into the cycle that you describe with your current relationship and at the same time you are still feeling stuck it also sounds like the distressing feelings that you experience when you imagine what will happen for you and your current partner are pretty overwhelming a competent therapist may be able to help you work through these difficult thoughts and feelings and find a resolution to this cycle that will feel right to you

whenever i dont tell my friends or anyone what i did or stuff thats not really important i feel terrible like theres a hole in my stomach it only goes away when i hurt myself,hi kansas i feel strongly that the help of a professional therapist is important here feelings are never wrong but it can help to understand where they come from and talk to someone who can teach you healthy ways to cope selfharm is not the answer to managing those emotions you feel in your stomach although im glad you said something here a professional would need to spend some time with you and get a deep understanding of your life in order to help you sort all these reactions out effectively i hope you reach out to someone soon
whenever i dont tell my friends or anyone what i did or stuff thats not really important i feel terrible like theres a hole in my stomach it only goes away when i hurt myself,sorry to hear of your situationpossibly you are overlooking that your own self is someone worth talking to as wellnone of us are ever really alone because we are always with ourselvesselftalk is a major part of what guides our decisions and how we make sense of relationships and situations   even after telling people the stories or activities hearing their comments it is always within ourselves that we decide if the way we were received by these others the comments we heard back feel right and accurate to our livesi hope the feeling of a hole in your stomach would decrease by enjoying your self   i am guessing that hurting yourself makes the stomach hole feel less bad because the physical pain you create in yourself distracts you from feeling itenjoying your self by talking kindly loving and having inner dialogue may very well decrease the feeling of a hole altogethersending lots of good luck
i was raped repeatedly when i was younger i told my parents and action was taken but now that im an adult i suffer from extreme anxiety,while anxiety can come about for many reasons trauma is definitely one of the factors that makes anxiety a possibility both immediately following a traumatic event and later in life when we have experienced such scary violations of our bodies  we may experience residual effects of fear for many years to come this is normal natural and in many ways helpful  at least initially this fear is in some way a sign that your bodymind is taking good care of you  trying to keep you on your toes in order to protect you from anything terrible happening to you again however as it sounds like you know anxiety feels awful and there are certainly ways of learning to reduce anxiety in order to get the tools you need to manage anxiety and also understand where it comes from and how it works in your life i would encourage you to seek professional help and check out anxiety resources online
i was raped repeatedly when i was younger i told my parents and action was taken but now that im an adult i suffer from extreme anxiety,hi even though thankfully your parents responded well to you telling them and you received treatment its possible and very normal for sexual abuse trauma to affect you in different ways as you age and develop please see a therapist who can help you find the root of the anxiety
i was raped repeatedly when i was younger i told my parents and action was taken but now that im an adult i suffer from extreme anxiety,its not unusual for traumatic experiences that happened when we were younger to stay with us when we get older  traumatic experiences can become embedded in our bodies as well as in our emotions  if the issue doesnt get a chance to get resolved within then external action doesnt necessarily take care of the problem  seek out a qualified trauma therapist so you can start to deal with the issues youre grappling with
i find myself being very outgoing most of the time but there are some times when i dont know what to say i dont even want to talk at all its like i search for the right thing to say and nothing ever comes out i dont know if im outgoing only to fill the void of not knowing what to say i dont know if people like that about me im very selfconscious and always think people are talking about me so it makes me have a cold shoulder and not want to talk,would you feel more secure in conversations if instead of talking soon after meeting someone or entering a social situation you simply listened attentively to the other peoplethis way youd have a more secure idea of what topics the group likes talking about and whether you like talking about these topics as wellmaybe you simply are in groups or situations in which you dont care for the people or focusstart by trusting your own evaluation of your true interest in being among the groups in which you aremaybe you simply need new and different groups
this is preventing me from getting a job i have bad relationship with my bipolar mother i am living with her but it stresses me out so much to be around her that i have locked myself in my room i have no friends or other family to help me i have no money for therapy but i think i need therapy before i can secure a job,overwhelming fear social anxiety and depression are especially painful because they make behaving constructively a challenge  but there are also lots of examples of folks who have successfully worked their way through this  so there is hope   in addition to the suggestion to visit your doctor who may prescribe a medication to help you relax there are many social service agencies who provide free counseling or take medicaid  a good cbt therapist will help you look at your thinking so that you may see how you are distorting your thoughts  behavior is also important  despite how you may feel it is helpful to go out to do things that relax you maybe a yoga class or a meditation class  exercise diet eat well think back on the things that you used to do that helped in the past and force yourself to do these things again  i know that this seems hard but it beats the alternative doesnt it  of course i recommend you pick up a copy of my book living yes which will help you look at these and other ideas to help you out  i hope you get unstuck soon  mark wwwmarkmorrislcswcom and wwwlivingyesorg

i feel like my time is going too fast,thank you for reaching out that is a great question as an american i can truly say that i spend way too much time on the go it is a proven fact that americans live in a fast paced environment compared to europe i often ask myself what if i only had one day left on this earth what would i do well that is an easy question i would spend it with my family easier said than done when we are living in a tomorrow kind of world right its hard to focus on the now when we are so consumed in what tomorrow shall bringtime management is a very important factor when learning to live life to the fullest in fact this is a required course in undergraduate college now everyone manages their time differently and it is up to you to decide how you would like to do this personally for myself i like to keep a calendar with a todo list i always place my most important tasks at the top of the list that way if i do not get through the list i am not stressing over the little things when planning your day it is important you schedule work eat and play a much as it is hard not to work after getting off work it must be done there is discipline involved in this process if you have trouble with this then maybe seeking out some accountability such as including a coworker to make sure you do not bring work home once your shift is over or your spousepartner reminding you that this is a time for play and not workthese are just some ideas that i am throwing out there again everyone has their own style on time management i hope this was helpful for you please dont hesitate to reach out for anything further
my dad refuses to acknowledge my anxieties about going to parties dinners etc whenever i have an opinion it gets shut down my mom and everyone else behaves likewise for my father who heads a company this is normal he has to be right all the time he blatantly refuses to even try to see it from my angle recently however its been getting to the point where i feel pressured and unable to speak my mind it isnt possible for me to get professional oneonone help he tells me to grow a pair and get over it i recently have been developing more severe body image and selfconfidence issues which i have had all my life i feel invalidated by my dad i have been more paranoid lately as well i cant turn on location services anymore on my phone because of a past incident he makes me feel guilty about it i feel rather worthless more often than not unfortunately what do i do,im sorry to hear that you are unable to get through to your parents it sounds like you are experiencing a great deal of anxiety that needs to be addressed by a professional despite the fact that you are unable to at the moment i would recommend talking with another adult such as a school counselor that can offer you support in this area perhaps they can work with you on your anxiety issues and schedule a meeting with your parents so that heshe may help mediate the conversation with themif you are unable to reach out to a school counselor maybe you can try a member of the family such as an aunt or an uncle that feels comfortable addressing the issue with your parents sometimes it helps hearing it from a third party before the situations is taken seriously enoughgood luck
whenever i leave my girlfriend i get panic attacks im taking medications to control them but im thinking of moving in with her since i get so anxious,im sorry to hear that you are currently experiencing panic attacks i hope that the medication you have been prescribed has provided you with some relief unfortunately i dont feel that moving in with your girlfriend would alleviate your anxiety although you may feel very anxious about leaving her your body is reacting to this stressful event in your life in an unhealthy manner you may be able to render this particular situation but its likely that you may experience another panic attack when an additional stressful event arises therefore it is essential that you address the reason for why you are experiencing panic attacks in the first place followed by practicing coping mechanisms in the case that one would arise in the futuretalk therapy has shown to be effective with those affected by anxiety along with breathing exercises and yoga a trained therapist will be able to assist you in finding the right stress reducing method so that you can reduce the chance of another attack occurringi wish you the best of luck it sounds like you are very happy in your relationship and i hope you are able to reduce your anxiety so that you are able to enjoy one another
i had a head injury a few years ago and my mind races all the time i have trouble sleeping and have a lot of anxiety every medicine i have been on my body rejects i get sick to my stomach and get blisters in my mouth how can i calm my self down im a wreck,you didnt say what or how many medications youve tried certain anxiety medications can make you feel nauseous but i havent heard of any that cause mouth blisters so there may be some other underlying medical issue there i would definitely talk to your primary care physician and whoever has prescribed the medication as well as a neurologist if youve suffered a severe head injury there are so many medications available for anxiety or insomnia or even depression that there may be others with lesser side effectsbut beyond that have you tried any other treatments such as deep breathing or meditation meditation can be very effective but it takes practice and you dont have to sit crosslegged for hours chanting ohm to meditate its about focusing on your breath rather than all the thoughts that are racing through your head and when they do take your mind off your breath simply refocus and refocus and refocus like i said it takes practice so dont give up you can find many sites offering different ways to meditate so look around and see what works best for you like medication you just have to find the one that works best and that might take some experimentationi hope this helps and best of luck to you
when my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school she starts crying and freaking out she is a bright student always has a 40 but i am afraid she is stressing too much im afraid its going to break her i dont know if i should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal,watching children go through challenges in their lives is difficult on a very basic level there exists a primal need to protect them from harm the hard part for parents is letting them feel those challenges and working through them as they get older at some point there is a moment that occurs when the role as a parent shifts children no longer need the basics food shelter water safety as much as when they were toddlers but rather their needs shift to wanting more support encouragement advice and room to make mistakes this is where the ability to communicate with them letting them direct the sails to gather the wind needed to move is so important keep the lines of communication open and be available to give feedback when they ask for it
when my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school she starts crying and freaking out she is a bright student always has a 40 but i am afraid she is stressing too much im afraid its going to break her i dont know if i should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal,oh dear  this is becoming all too common i suggest you have some conversations with your girl to figure out where she is getting the information that she builds anxiety around i see teens who have heard teachers parents coaches etc push the highly selective colleges idea on kids way too much teens in particular are prone to black and white thinking leading them to see one poor test performance one off day one notgreat assignment as the makeorbreak task on the path to successful adulthood if thats the case with your daughter she needs you to help modulate both the incoming information there are nearly 5000 colleges in the us  she will get into one of them as well as her reaction to that informationas well you and any other adults that are involved in parenting her need to discern fact from fiction the recent scandal around celebrities buying their kids into college is an indicator of how far off track we as a culture have gotten in terms of education a college education is certainly important but we have allowed the marketing push to create so much stress and upset for our kids and ourselves as parents that they are actually less prepared to leave home and really engage in higher education than everyou may want to include a therapist in these conversations if you get stuck but start with a parentchild conversation help her figure out what is going on  if it is the i have to get it right or i will have no future calmly walk her through all the evidence that says thats just not true as well let her know that being anxious now is not preparing her for a bright adulthood  its preparing her for an anxious future she needs help figuring out how to balance her effort to attend to real and reasonable expectations not overinflated fearbased actions
when my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school she starts crying and freaking out she is a bright student always has a 40 but i am afraid she is stressing too much im afraid its going to break her i dont know if i should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal,sometimes stress helps us become motivated and thrive to do better however if your daughter is stressing to the point that she is crying and freaking out then that would be concerning helping your daughter with relaxation techniques like deep breathing or guided imagery would be a good start also reminding your daughter that you see her doing so well in school and that most importantly you are there for her i would also make an appointment to see a mental health therapist they can have more ideas on ways to destress
when my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school she starts crying and freaking out she is a bright student always has a 40 but i am afraid she is stressing too much im afraid its going to break her i dont know if i should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal,the most important action you can take here is validating her feelings and staying calm when she is crying and freaking out  its equally important to do some self exploration regarding your own thoughts feelings and behaviors towards making mistakes and how you respond to your mistakes   when she is calm ask her what a mistake means to her  giving her examples of different kinds of mistakes and listening to her responses will give you an idea of how extreme her thoughts are  taking this opportunity to share with her your own struggles with perfectionism or some other area would help her feel more at ease  reminding her that she is enough just as she is would be helpful as well  encouraging her self care routine will help develop a greater sense of balance regarding her priorities  the practice of mindfulness will be helpful in self awareness  creating a plan on what to do when the early signs of freaking out surface will strengthen her coping skills   your fears as a parent are completely understandable and this definitely needs to be addressed  your daughter cannot bring about change on her own and will need the family to work towards this change as well  a therapist that specializes in anxietyperfectionism would be a great resource  they may also help you all have a greater understanding of what the root of this need for perfection is and how it plays a role in the family  i suggest one or two sessions without your daughter would be helpful to develop a course of action   i hope this was helpful  it takes a lot of courage to seek help and guidance im glad you posted
when my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school she starts crying and freaking out she is a bright student always has a 40 but i am afraid she is stressing too much im afraid its going to break her i dont know if i should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal,i hear your concern that your daughter might break under the pressure and stress that she is dealing with it is a good thing that your high achieving daughter is calling out for help and that you are listening the education system is wrought with social and emotional problems and there is a disproportionate emphasis on test taking scores and achievement in school  it sounds like your daughter would benefit from some social and emotional education and learning to understand how her feelings are impacting her thoughts and behaviors  id like to also assure you that crying and freaking out is a normal part of growing up depending on your daughters age it is likely that she is going through a growth spurt and she may be feeling her feelings in a unique way to her too if this is the first time you are having a concern about anxiety then rest at ease and see if you can ride the emotions with her and be a stable sounding board for her  use empathy and compassion and allow her a safe place to process through her concerns try not to solve it for her but allow her a space to fumble through and find her own answers to the problems she is faced with give her confidence that she can figure it out and be patient as you sit with her our presence is key to our childrens well being  make eye contact with her allow her to squirm and get frustrated and work through it while you witness her process as parents when we can model calm in the storm of life our children learn that all of their feelings are ok too when our children see and feel our fear it can create more insecurity and low self evaluation of their own efficacy to manage the stress when we can be calm and reassuring then we can boost their confidence in their own ability to problem solve what they are going through lets face it we all have irrational thinking from time to time and usually it is when we are under stress  if your daughter continues to show concerning anxiety check with her school and see if she can benefit from an opportunity with the social emotional learning curriculum in texas at least schools are required to have resources for children like your daughter who are experiencing anxiety and other mental health concerns her teacher is with her all day and you may request to have a conference with her to see if she can help her in any way as well if resources in your school are limited then i would seek an outside therapist who specializes in working with children your daughters age call around and see if she can benefit from a therapeutic relationship outside of school and home once you have plenty of feedback from her teacher and a therapist or counselor then you will be able to determine if seeking medical care is necessary with their support and guidance thank you for your courage to reach out for help on behalf of your daughter you are her greatest advocate i hope that you find support to help you navigate this time in her life and that you both grow and learn from this experience
when my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school she starts crying and freaking out she is a bright student always has a 40 but i am afraid she is stressing too much im afraid its going to break her i dont know if i should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal,aye youre correct that isnt normal and maybe you should get her to a doctorbefore you do that and if she were my daughter i would provide her the necessary physical support that can be given readily at home that is proper natural diet rest and a good sense of detoxification before she readies herself to approach itbasic listening is warranted here and would be of great use

when my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school she starts crying and freaking out she is a bright student always has a 40 but i am afraid she is stressing too much im afraid its going to break her i dont know if i should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal,as parents its hard not to have freak out moments when our children are being bullied stressed or exhibit other symptoms of teenage angst we walk a delicate balance of letting go and giving autonomy to our teens get older adolescents are learning how to be functional adults and its important to allow them to try and sometimes fail in managing their emotions grades are a pretty good indicator of how a student is doing overall if your daughter has a 40 and theres no pattern of crying and freaking out id offer gentle support and encourage her to find ways to relax when shes stressed if her grades start to decline and her crying spells become more frequent a call to a counselor who specializes in teens might be in order good luck
when my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school she starts crying and freaking out she is a bright student always has a 40 but i am afraid she is stressing too much im afraid its going to break her i dont know if i should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal,i am sorry to hear about your daughter many of the youth i see in my practice are going through similar behaviors and concerns if she feels like she can talk to you about this i think that is a great place to begin there are many life stressors that youth have to manage and seeing others on social media seems to exacerbate these feelings and can feel like even more pressure to strive for perfection you may be able to offer her support by listening to and validating her concerns reviewing all that she has accomplished and praising her for doing her best and not push that she needs to be the bestif she feels she would like to speak to someone it may be good to find a therapist where she can vent her feelings and find a way to increase her coping skills she may benefit from additional support outside the home where she can cry learn to manage her worries and gain skills to triage the expectations of each day she may benefit from skills that would help her to learn that she is enough already

when my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school she starts crying and freaking out she is a bright student always has a 40 but i am afraid she is stressing too much im afraid its going to break her i dont know if i should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal,thank you for being an observant parent and taking the very important step toward getting help for you as well as your daughter the period of adolescence and emerging adulthood are tumultuous times for youth  and their parents the pressure to fitin be liked and succeed could be some of the contributing factors for your daughters stress i have had many adolescent clients who do very well academically but keep it well hidden from their peers so that they can fit in she is still learning about herself her abilities and how to like herself none of which are easy tasks even for adults the academic success that you refer to only tells part of the story as i read your statement i got a sense of what your daughter does and that you are proud of her academic accomplishments however i would also want to ask her who she is as a person and encourage her to explore that with assistance from a therapistby working with a therapist your daughter will have the opportunity to discuss her stress fears and focus on achievement with an objective person as she gains a better understanding of the source of her stress and learns some stress management she can also learn to communicate her concerns to you i do recommend starting with a therapist rather than the doctor if the therapist believes that your daughters symptoms would benefit from a health exam andor medication they will make that recommendation
when my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school she starts crying and freaking out she is a bright student always has a 40 but i am afraid she is stressing too much im afraid its going to break her i dont know if i should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal,hello first of all thank you for paying attention to your daughter and noticing that she is concerned it sounds like you have been a positive influence on her for her to be so focused on achievement and for her to care so deeply about her performance based on what youve said here i understand that you are concerned that she is overly stressed though i share your concern people of all ages have meltdowns when they become overwhelmed with stress and the negative consequences of those meltdowns can definitely have a rippleeffect into other areas of our livesfor your daughter the thing i would want to know first is this does she feel she has adequate healthy coping skills to manage the stress she is experiencing because it doesnt really matter what she is stressing onwhat matters is how she deals with her stress when it threatens to overwhelm her id like to know what exactly that she does when she is feeling stressed that helps her to feel better if she has only unhealthy coping skills for example sleeping shuttingdown raging selfattack with critical selftalk etc or only one or two healthy skills we would want to teach her some additional healthy strategies to help her know that she can cope just one risk of not addressing this issue now could be that she may come to learn that stress is unbearable which may cause her to turn to destructive or escapist strategies to avoid the discomfort the pain of feeling hopeless andor the negative belief that she cannot help herself  i definitely think it would be worth both your whiles to have her evaluated by her family doctor andor a professional counselor with a counselor specifically she could learn the needed skills as well as be evaluated for other issues that may be contributing to the issue for example a learned belief that she must be perfect or she is not worthy plus having a neutral support person to help her meet her personal goals is always a good thing good luck mom and daughterlearn more about me and my practice at wwwemdrhealscom

when my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school she starts crying and freaking out she is a bright student always has a 40 but i am afraid she is stressing too much im afraid its going to break her i dont know if i should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal,its hard to answer this question based on the information presented but i shall give it a go is it possible that your daughter is afraid of failing ive seen many children and kids who get stressed out over grades or performance in sports can you tell me what was your grade in fourth grade english or what was the score of the 7th game you played in football when you were a junior much of what happens to us is insignificant and we worry over things which really  in the long term dont matter much to us but ask yourself this question is your daughters reaction to what is going grossly out of proportion with what would normally be expected if the answer is yes a visit to a psychotherapist might not be a bad idea to learn some coping skills and to alter our reaction to life
when my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school she starts crying and freaking out she is a bright student always has a 40 but i am afraid she is stressing too much im afraid its going to break her i dont know if i should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal,i agree with your observation about your daughter feeling stressed  are you able to open this topic in conversation with heralso reflect on your own expectations as a parent  it is possible that your daughter is trying to please you by getting consistently high gradesif your daughter prefers talking in confidence to a therapist then this may help her regain a sense of balance in her life so that schoolwork feels less stressfuli wouldnt take her to a doctor because based on what you write the problem is psychological and emotionally based  while the stress may have physical symptoms addressing the root cause of the problem has nothing to do directly with something being physically wrong with your daughterunless there is some other medical or physical problem that would explain your daughters sense of stress  id start first by bringing your areas of concern to your daughter then possibly to a therapist

my daughter seemed to be developing at a normal rate until about the age of 10 she then started to act younger than she is now she only wants to play with younger kids and she doesnt act her age i dont know why this is happening is this normal,this is certainly an important issue to look into it is always helpful to speak with the childs pediatrician since they are most familiar with the childs developmental history also children tend to regress behaviorally when facing events and interactions they feel to have no control over this can be as simple as a loss of a pet a recent move death in the family  andor as serious as sexual abuse and other things if you have not spoken to the school that can be a good starting point
my daughter seemed to be developing at a normal rate until about the age of 10 she then started to act younger than she is now she only wants to play with younger kids and she doesnt act her age i dont know why this is happening is this normal,your daughter is fortunate to have an observant parent who is willing to seek out help in this regard regression can be indicative of some stress in your childs life so the issues she is facing should be examined seeking advice from your daughters pediatrician as well as a practitioner familiar with adolescent issues or perhaps play therapy can equip you with insight into the causes of the behavior and give you tools to assist your daughter in learning age appropriate social interactions
my daughter seemed to be developing at a normal rate until about the age of 10 she then started to act younger than she is now she only wants to play with younger kids and she doesnt act her age i dont know why this is happening is this normal,helloit sounds like you are really concerned about your daughter because you have noticed a significant change in her behavior   its really a great first step that you are reaching out to get some ideas about what might be going on   you are clearly an observant and hands on  mom who wants to be sure that her daughter is okthis is a tough question to answer without more information   with that said  i have found that under stress people regress  in other words  many people  children and adults alike  often regress and behave differently  as if they were younger than their actual age  when under stress   therefore  my first question would be  has anything been happening recently that is causing your daughter stress   this could be anything from conflict at home  recent changes such as moving  divorce  a loss of some kind  switching schools  or losing a friend or friends   additionally  sometimes if children are feeling bullied or left out by same age peers  they may gravitate toward younger playmates as a way to boost their social confidence    i would suggest that you think about what stressors  changes may have occurred recently  you may also want to check in with her teacher s to see if they have noticed any changes in your daughters behavior at school i also think that you can have a conversation with your daughter in order to see if you can get a sense about whether or not something has been bothering her  something as simple as  i have noticed that you arent spending time with the friends you used to hang out with  it seems like you have been playing with a lot of younger kids lately   am i right about that   and then if she says yes you might ask a few questions such as  did something happen with your friends that  is making you not want to be with them has something been bothering you lately  are you feeling upset or worried   if she denies that there is anything wrong you might even say  i know that sometimes when i feel stressed or worried  i tend to act a little differently  sometimes i withdraw from my regular group of friends  or i get cranky and feel less like myself   i wonder if something like that is happening with you  if you are really concerned and not getting any answers from her and  or her teachers  perhaps you can consult with a therapist to discuss your concerns further and decide if it might  help for your daughter to talk to a therapist a few times  or at the very least you can get more specific tips from a therapist about how to approach this issue with your daughter more effectively  the more detail you can provide about what you have noticed with your daughter  including any changes or new stressors   any possible patterns to this behavior  if school has become more difficult socially and or academically  the more a therapist can guide you about how best to handle your concerns and talk with your daughter in a way that is helpful to her good luck  i believe that this may just be a phase and it seems to me to be well within the normal range of childrens behavior  i do though think that you will feel more assured about this  if you can get to the bottom of whats going on 
my daughter seemed to be developing at a normal rate until about the age of 10 she then started to act younger than she is now she only wants to play with younger kids and she doesnt act her age i dont know why this is happening is this normal,good for you to know your daughters friendship circles and to notice when these have changedwhile friendships are key relationships they are not the only indicator of someone not developing normallyis your observation and opinion that your daughter isnt normal based on other factors or just this oneif this is the only factor then start with reflecting on what circumstances may be influencing your daughter to socialize with younger kidshas she ben ostracized or bullied by her peers and may be retreating to avoid further emotional hurtis she keeping up with her school worksometimes kids who feel overwhelmed by schoolwork will regress into conditions in which they feel more success and controlare there family circumstances such as the death of someone with whom your daughter felt close  or is there a new younger sibling in the family or a younger sibling who due to their own circumstance receives more attention than your daughter may wish for herselfonce youve reflected on which areas may be affecting your daughter gently ask her some questions about her comfort with what you theorize may be the source of the problemits also possible that offering her your extra time and interest may increase her sense of self so that she feels secure enough to increase her social time with her age group
my exwife married and used me to have a child she now uses that child as a pawn i know my child misses me but i need to move on and not live in the past how do i do this do i see my child as much as possible or very little is it more confusing for the child,you can move on and not live in the past in the context of your exrelationship but that does not mean moving on from your child moving on then would involve accepting the end of the relationship and developing a civil relationship with your expartner as far as is possible for the sake of your childs developmentgenerally its good for a functional nonabusive parent to spend time with hisher child but only insofar as that doesnt cause your child unnecessary stress that requires the two adults to act like adults with each other for the sake of their childwhats confusing for children is seeing their parents act uncivilly or manipulatively children also do well with routines so regular dependable visitation is preferable to random visitation or worse not following through on commitmentsbut if one person is exploiting their child to harm their expartner then visiting your child in that context may be stressful to himher depending on what you mean by using your child as a pawn when dealing with a hostile expartner your first challenge is to negotiate rules and boundaries with your expartner about appropriate behavior for the good of your child if you cannot come to an agreement a counselor can help mediate a conversation if thats not an option then it may be possible to turn to family court to stipulate visitation rules for which youd have to consult with an attorney

my exwife married and used me to have a child she now uses that child as a pawn i know my child misses me but i need to move on and not live in the past how do i do this do i see my child as much as possible or very little is it more confusing for the child,hi your situation sounds very complicated and sensitive  it is important to handle it with care as it involves your children  when parents are attempting to coparent the clearer the boundaries and expectations are the easier it gets to effectively coparent  parenting your child is not œliving in the past allow me to reframe that approach and instead view it as an investment in your future  your child will forever be your child and deserves and active loving and caring father  staying away sends a different message to your child and leaves room for resentment  find a way to create an agreement between you and your exwife with the best interest of your child as the focus  the courts are able to assist with this goal as well
my exwife married and used me to have a child she now uses that child as a pawn i know my child misses me but i need to move on and not live in the past how do i do this do i see my child as much as possible or very little is it more confusing for the child,the thing that confuses a child the most is for a parent to come and go from their life children have a way of making things their fault even when they have done nothing wrong because of this when parents cut off contact the child thinks its their fault as hard as that already is for a child it is even worse when a parent pops in and out of their life this makes the belief even more strong for them they start to think why does dad keep leaving what am i doing to keep making him go awayi believe a child needs both parents in their life whether she used you for a child or not that child still exists and never asked for this they didnt ask to be born into drama and two parents that cant make things work you can move on and start over while still maintaining a relationship with your child if you start over far away this may mean less visits but youll still be a part of their life just make sure when you make a commitment to this child to stick to it every child deserves that much good luck to you 
my exwife married and used me to have a child she now uses that child as a pawn i know my child misses me but i need to move on and not live in the past how do i do this do i see my child as much as possible or very little is it more confusing for the child,what are the ways your exwife uses your child as a pawnthis answer determines the best ways to handle particular situationsbasically distinguish that your father relationship to your child lasts has great meaning for your child and as the adult the responsibility for managing this relationship falls on youyour relationship to your ex wife took place between two adults and therefore you are only responsible for your own actions to repair the damage done to youfrom what you write you already have a plan in progress to do this by separating yourself as much as possible from contact with the exin a way the challenge of keeping active as a parent while also distancing and clearing your emotions of the hurt and betrayal done to you will establish both a solid relationship with your child and grow more acceptance and selfforgiveness of having been taken advantage of and tricked
my exwife married and used me to have a child she now uses that child as a pawn i know my child misses me but i need to move on and not live in the past how do i do this do i see my child as much as possible or very little is it more confusing for the child,i am really glad you reached out when parents get divorced they still need to figure out how to have relationship so that they can parent their child we might divorce our partners however we dont divorce our children if anything our children need to know that we are still a stable force in their lives unfortunately in some relationships children get used as a bargaining piece and i am hearing that may be happening in your relationship you can move on from the relationship with your ex while still maintaining a relationship with your child it is possible and it takes both parents to agree to do the right thing by their child it is important for your children to have some consistency in his or her time with you for example if you and your ex dont have a parenting schedule it is something that you want to create so that you can not only decide for you when you will see your child but your child can know when you will be available just for her this will lay the foundation for consistency and allow your child to have some security in troubled timesi would highly recommend you sit down with your ex and discuss how you can both be a positive source in your childs life how you can both be there to help raise her if this is not a conversation that you can have on your own you might seek out help from the court there are parenting experts and mediators who might be able to assist youremember in any discussion keep the focus on what is best for your child and you will be moving in the right directionbest of luck to you
my exwife married and used me to have a child she now uses that child as a pawn i know my child misses me but i need to move on and not live in the past how do i do this do i see my child as much as possible or very little is it more confusing for the child,if you have a good relationship with your child then you have already accepted and been accepted as this childs parent and you have a commitment and an obligation to play that role  if you suddenly absent yourself from this childs life then you may be doing real damage working out an arrangement with the childs mother for regular visits the child can count on and committed to by both parents will serve the best interest of the child which i assume is what both parents are truly concerned with  the visits dont have to be every day once a week even once a month is better than hit and miss with long absences in between  best of luck to you and the fact that you asked the question says volumes about your parenting potential  feel free to follow up with me on line or in person
my exwife married and used me to have a child she now uses that child as a pawn i know my child misses me but i need to move on and not live in the past how do i do this do i see my child as much as possible or very little is it more confusing for the child,youre in a difficult situation and on behalf of you and your child i commend you for trying to find the right thing to doshort version your child needs you as much as possible period always we used to think that children were almost always harmed by divorce unless there was extreme conflict or violence more recent data shows that children are not necessarily harmed by divorce if they keep both their parents in other words the damaging part is losing half of themselves and losing the value of being connected to everyone who loves them especially the other parent in addition to the extra benefit there is from the other parents perspective strengths and so on the best thing for your child is for you to be available and loving and doing everything possible to allow the child to be whole  a person who incorporates both parents its a tragedy for everyone to use a child to achieve adult aims like getting back at a former spouse in such a circumstance your child needs you more than ever if you and your wife have different rules and so on your child will learn to adjust and adapt just as they would if you remained in the household a child quickly learns that they talk to mom about xyz or get away with whatever but has different rules with dad heshe will not be too confused in the long run please stay the course in dealing with a difficult exwife for you and your childs wellbeing best of luck to all
i am a counselor at day camp where we have a child with severe autism we try to keep him entertained by carrying cards around for when he starts acting up so we can get him to focus on something else the day camp administrator has told us not to yell at him because he will zone out and not listen so we just talk in a calm voice however other kids see the treatment as unfair,behavioral interaction with someone who has severe autism requires highly specialized training both for any professional staff involved with the person and for the family membersit is an unfair situation for both the person who has autism as well as the campers who do not to expect both sides to get along harmoniouslyin order to achieve this the campers would need specialized training to know how to respond to distress in the camper who has autismthis would obviously stretch and burden the summer camp budget as well as provide an activity which usually isnt part of summer camp for childrenwhat you can do which may be productive in helping the camper who has autism is to point out the interaction difficulty to the summer administratorsultimately it is their problem to only take campers who are able to reasonably adjust to socializing together and from what you write the administration has overreached whom they consider reasonable camper mates
when my son was a teenager we sent him to live with his dad because of the constant disrespectful attitude a week after he graduated his dad made him leave because of the same issues all four parents tried to talk to him and he just refuses help all around he is now living with his grandparents he had a job and took steps to get his license and an insured vehicle i thought he was heading down the right road and then he tells me he quit his job because he didnt like it i just dont know what to do,probably the best way to be supportive of your son is to tell him what bothers you about the way hes handling himselfif youd like him to work with your suggestions then before you make critical comments be sure to validate his strong points and to recognize his natural talentspeople are much more likely to take advice if the person feels the criticism is spoken by someone who respects them and isnt only critical of themoffer your availability to talk with him if you genuinely feel available to speak with him in a nonjudgmental way

she cried because she lost all trust in me now i feel disgusting and like my heart just got stabbed what do i do,you felt bad when you lied so you told the truth i imagine your mom was really shocked and upset  both of those things tell me you are a pretty honest person its possible that your mom had a big reaction simply because she has learned that her child from whom she always assumed honesty was capable of being dishonest thats not awesome but its not the end of the world you made a mistake  youll make more of those in your life just try not to make the same ones over and over againit sounds like you and your mom are close so i can see why it would feel so awful to have her distrust you since you are a fundamentally honest person the way back to being trusted is going to be simple but may take a little time the recipe is easy  say what you are doinggoing to do do only that unless change is necessary in which case you inform others involved and repeat  and cut yourself some slack your mom will recover and so will you its an important and painful lesson about integrity but once learned it will serve you well
she cried because she lost all trust in me now i feel disgusting and like my heart just got stabbed what do i do,it sounds like youve already learned that just being honest is often the best approach what do you think about telling your mom how youre feeling  she might really appreciate it if you also let her know that regaining her trust is really important to you
she cried because she lost all trust in me now i feel disgusting and like my heart just got stabbed what do i do,hey sounds like the part of you that knows the right thing to do won here i am so proud of you for admitting that you lied to your mom sometimes lies come out of our mouths before we can even catch them because we are trying to say what the other person wants to hear i bet that as you begin to show her that you are not going to lie any more she will begin to gain trust in you again be open with your feelings with you mom  she is there to support you guide you and love you give her lots of hugs  and give yourself one too for being so brave be wise
there is just no communication at all between us she sleeps constantly all day not at night she acts angry and unfocused and stays in her very messy room all the time the only time she comes out is to eat she has aches and fatigue weight gain hair loss and skin problems she does not look after her health i dont know how to communicate with her she is not open to any suggestions how do i get through to her,that sounds awful and is clearly unsustainable there are some great answers that give some guidance about what might be an underlying condition if all physical and mental health issues are ruled out its time to take action get backup from friends or family members if you need to but let your daughter know you are giving her 30 days notice she needs to find another place to live within that time if she wants to stay with you be clear that first she has to go with a potential to return after she has been out for a good chunk of time once out she can prove to you and more importantly to herself that she is capable of maintaining her health and her environment remember you are going to rule out issues that would make it impossible for her to be successful if she is in good health her staying with you and living this way is actually harming her

my son stole my debit card and lied about it its not the first time he has lied i dont know what to do anymore i dont know if i should punish him or make him do something ive tried talking to him and asking if anything was wrong i have grounded him but nothing works what should i do,a lot depends on the age of your child but given that it was a misused debit card i am going to guess hes a teen assuming that there are a couple of important things to keep in mind1 that he lied about the misuse indicates he knows he was in the wrong thats a dreadful feeling  getting caught out and an impulsive lie may have popped out of his mouth before he thought it through after all a debit spend is pretty easy to track  2 once he lied he stuck with the lie  somewhere along the line even though he knew that you knew he wasnt telling the truth he stuck with his story and as you said its not the first time he lied now it looks like a habit has formedgoing forward when there is a dishonest act of any kind its essential that you set it up so your son can be truthful simply put do not ask questions if you know for certain that he has for example misused your debit card say so asking did you invites him to get creative with denial asking why did you implies that with a good enough reason he might not be in hot water with you instead say what is i see this charge on my debit card and realize you used it without my permission you can only do this if you know for sure it was him but it sounds like you do  if he meets with denial stay calm restate that you are aware this happened then deliver consequences that match the transgression he has to return the item if its returnable or find a way to pay you back for the charge as well as any fees incurred in using it make it harder to find your card because he isnt that great at curbing the impulse to use it yetand most importantly once the consequence is delivered you have to let it go continuing to bring it up wont benefit him but it does have the potential to make him more sneaky every time he asks respectfully to use it whether you allow him to or not be sure to praise him for asking nicely catch him doing it right as often as possiblehang in there  this isnt super unusual behavior but it isnt acceptable so address it but dont let yourself get too wound up about it
my son stole my debit card and lied about it its not the first time he has lied i dont know what to do anymore i dont know if i should punish him or make him do something ive tried talking to him and asking if anything was wrong i have grounded him but nothing works what should i do,hi enid you sound like a sensitive parent i like that you talked to your son to see if anything is wrong there is some key information here i dont know your sons age whether he spent any money whether he put the card back or how many times hes stolen and my answer might be different depending on those details but ill give you my thoughtsi see it as every childs job to figure out the rules and find where their power is in the world in order to accomplish that many of them test limits what can i get away with is a question they have to find the answer to if a child knows the rules theyre much more likely to not test limits because they already know the limits so part of testing limits is experimenting with stealing and lying not all kids steal but i would say pretty much every child lies at some point its a normal behaviour and most of the time its about small things that dont matter and we dont even find out stealing a debit card is a bit more serious and im not surprised he lied about it if you absolutely know that he took it its okay to tell him that you believe he did this thing and also lied about it its appropriate to give a consequence for this type of behaviour so that the child doesnt do it again the consequence should be as natural and logical as possible the behaviour stealing was harmful to you so doing you a favour with extra chores might be a good idea its funny because as parents we try to tell our kids that lying is bad but they know theyll get a consequence if they tell the truth so there are natural deterrents to being honest we dont want people to know our mistakes its a dilemma if you really want to focus on the lying part you can tell him that you wont give him a consequence for the lying if he decides to come clean with the truth within one day that gives him incentive to come to you with truth it sometimes works with kids to give them a chance to come clean and then reward them for telling the truth you can set your child up for success and train them to tolerate honesty put a cookie on the counter tell your child to take the cookie at some point in the day then ask them later if they took the cookie youre making honesty fun kids love games basically theres as much power in rewarding the positive behaviour as punishing the negative if this is the first serious offence for your son dont make a big deal of it consequence him and see if he learns if its a pattern thats different and you may want the input of a therapist
im concerned about my 12 year old daughter about a month or two ago she started walking on her toes as well as coloring and writing very messy this all happened very suddenly she has never walked on her tiptoes and has always colored and written very neatly is this something i should be concerned abou any advice will help,it is great that you are noticing these changes with your daughter i cant offer advice without knowing much more about your particular situation but some things to think abouthas something else happen recently that has been stressful upsettingis your daughter trying to communicate something to you and if so what might that behave you discussed these recent changes with her without being too serious or accusatorythere is so much changing for her and you nowcommunication and connection are crucial i hope you both can talk to a supportive person about all these changes
im concerned about my 12 year old daughter about a month or two ago she started walking on her toes as well as coloring and writing very messy this all happened very suddenly she has never walked on her tiptoes and has always colored and written very neatly is this something i should be concerned abou any advice will help,have you asked your daughter why shes doing the behaviors you describeoften the best way to find out why someone does something is to simply ask them their reasonher answer will give you some guidance as to next possible stepsif shes pretending to be a fantasy figure or trying to find out how being taller feels or walking on high heels or some other image then knowing this rules out that she has some unbearable pain in her arch which may require more practical answers such as new shoes or even indicate a medical problemask if shes noticed any change in the way she walks   maybe she doesnt know shes doing this and maybe she feels embarrassed to tell you shes doing something a bit oddsince usually 12 year olds dont color is it new that she started coloringmaybe given the fact of messy handwriting shes in a phase of pretending or reflecting on good times as a young childthen this becomes the topic of examinationdoes she feel insecure about being on the cusp of adolescencesome of these questions can be asked directly and some are for you to first decide based on what you know of your daughter which questions and what direction to take in understanding your daughters motivation
i have three children the oldest is nine and not my biological child the middle child is three and the youngest is one i have a great relationship with the oldest two children but i havent developed the same level of attatchment to the youngest child i rarely want her around and look forward to her nap times is this normal,this is your experience your feeling and you are wondering if it is normal which means is this common or the rule this question about how you feel about your third child leads me to believe you are dis turbed etymology agitated or stirred up  feelings are messages from our soul or spirit that something is not right  so though  it might be normal common the rule  to look forward to a one year olds nap time when you have a three year old a nine year old the dis turbance or stirring up in you is important and requires your attention your listening if you will to your higher self
i have three children the oldest is nine and not my biological child the middle child is three and the youngest is one i have a great relationship with the oldest two children but i havent developed the same level of attatchment to the youngest child i rarely want her around and look forward to her nap times is this normal,this is a common response parents can have there are many reasons for attachment disruption  but attachment is important for the child as well as your long term relationship with them  i would want to know more about the history of the child and any stressors you have gone through during the childs lifetime often if there is stress parents will not have the time or energy to attach well to the child sometimes the energy of the child and the parent are mismatched as well but whatever is at the core this is something that can be addressed in counseling the earlier the better because adult relationships are based on parental relationships we had as children therapy can start at age 3 to address these types of issues visit staceybshapirocom for more information about getting started
i have three children the oldest is nine and not my biological child the middle child is three and the youngest is one i have a great relationship with the oldest two children but i havent developed the same level of attatchment to the youngest child i rarely want her around and look forward to her nap times is this normal,congrats on being honest about the way you feelmany people state having a favorite child so the reverse would also be possible of having a least favorite childtry to understand your own reasons for not liking your youngest child as much as the othersone point to consider is whether it is the child personality or the way they interact with you which gives you the feeling of not liking this child as much as the others or does the reason have more to do with younger children requiring more carealso do you generally prefer older kids to younger ones   it is possible the problem will go away as your youngest grows olderis there another parent in the household who can make up for what you feel unable to naturally give to your youngestis it possible you feel your own need to be involved with activities or to have time on your own  maybe you simply need a break from constant motheringcontinue to give as much as possible to your youngest child

shes in her early 20s and she has a toddler,this is something you will have to discuss with your husband  it should be a joint decision if you value your marriage  you can mention your frustration about your stepdaughter not honoring boundaries  after you talk to your husband you both can have a talk with your stepdaughter about expectations in order to stay living in the house  when it comes to stepchildren you need to be very careful you do not take the lead on the authority part  it should be the biological parent
shes in her early 20s and she has a toddler,it may be helpful to first have a discussion about what you are expecting and put a timeframe on it that if she is not doing certain things by a certain date she will have to leave if you dont know where she can go there is probably a list of shelters for the county that you live in
my dad is always and i mean always cussing and screaming at me for no reason at all he makes me feel stupid he also compares me to my other siblings in a negative way and demeans me is this abuse,oh my goodness my heart goes out to you  i pray you have other strong and supportive loved ones or friends surrounding you if you are in school please consider speaking with a counselor on site who can help give you some good coping mechanisms as well as other resourcesi believe most therapists would agree that this type of behavior is indicative of emotional and verbal abuse and quite often the two overlap because someone who is being yelled at and demeaned is also frequently having hisher emotions preyed upon as well healthy place offers us some great examples of emotional abuse which certainly fit the criteria of what you describeyelling or swearing name calling or insults mockingthreats and intimidationignoring or excludingisolatinghumiliatingdenial of the abuse and blaming of the victimand abuse survivor and author kellie jo holly offers some other great examples of verbal abuseemotionally abusive statementsyoure so cute when you try to concentrate look at you trying to thinki cant believe i love a stupid jerkaw come on cant you take a jokesexually abusive statementsyou should know how to please me by nowi hoped you were less experiencedstop acting like a whorefinancially abusive statementsyou are going to nickel and dime me to deathin what world does buying that make sensefine you handle your finances let me know when things go to hellsocietally abusive statementshow dare you spread around our private businesslet me do the talking people listen to menyou took a vow in front of god and everybody and i expect you to honor itthreatening and intimidating statementsif you dont train that dog im going to rub your nose in its messi will take our kids if you leave meyoure scared this isnt angry you will know when im angryspiritually abusive statementkeep your stupid beliefs to yourselfgod will find a way to get you back and it aint gonna be prettyi can feel myself being pulled into hell just listening to your nonsenseits been my personal clinical experience that children who are experiencing the types of things you describe often say they feel misunderstood lonely or scared and dont want to make things worse by standing up for themselves even if you feel you cant defend yourself outwardly that doesnt mean your fathers awful and toxic behavior is something you should ever internalize ie believe to be true which is why i hope you are surrounding yourself with people who will speak life and positivity back over you  we are all worthy of respect love and kindness dont ever forget thatmy love and light to you hontamara powell lmhc
my dad is always and i mean always cussing and screaming at me for no reason at all he makes me feel stupid he also compares me to my other siblings in a negative way and demeans me is this abuse,im really sorry to hear that you are going through thisits a little difficult to answer your question because the laws that define child abuse are different from state to state but usually things like what you describe your dad is doing are not considered to be child abusethe more important thing is how you feel about what is going on it sounds like this is really bothering youif you dont think you can talk to your dad about how you feel you might want to try talking to another adult you trust like a family member or teacher they may be able to help you figure out some ways to communicate with your dadi think you might feel better if you can talk to someone about how your are feeling
my dad is always and i mean always cussing and screaming at me for no reason at all he makes me feel stupid he also compares me to my other siblings in a negative way and demeans me is this abuse,yes this emotional abuse  there is no abuse without emotional abuse  his abuse is demeaning and can have lasting negative impact on your perspective of your self and people around you  please find someone support to talk to
my dad is always and i mean always cussing and screaming at me for no reason at all he makes me feel stupid he also compares me to my other siblings in a negative way and demeans me is this abuse,everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect having said that everyone gets upset once in awhile and may yell or scream which can be disrespectful you said always and i mean always and that is troubling if your dad curses and screams at you on a regular and consistent basis it can as you stated impact the way you feel about yourself while the definitions of child abuse differ from state to state talking to someone can help perhaps there is a counselor at school or another trustworthy person you could confide in to help you understand how this situation is impacting you counseling is a good option there is also help available through the national hotline at 18004224453 24 hours a day 7 days a week you can call press 1 and talk to a counselor while being anonymous you can also check out this website httpswwwchildhelporghotlineresourceskidsi am sorry that you are going though this situation there is help available you do not have to go through this situation alone
my dad is always and i mean always cussing and screaming at me for no reason at all he makes me feel stupid he also compares me to my other siblings in a negative way and demeans me is this abuse,yes screaming and cussing at your child is considered abusehere are two points i suggest you consider for your situationif your dad is ever calm when you and him are with one another  ask for some time to talk about your relationship with himschedule it for sometime in the near future from your request  this way he has time to consider his points of view on his relationship to you  even if he does no thinking about your relationship at all he will not feel pressured by the surprise of suddenly being expected to talk about a topic he may prefer to prepare himselfmy second point to you is to keep steady in your own views of who you are  when a parent demeans and mistreats a child the child is affected in a negative way  concentrate on loving yourself and keeping people in your friendship circle who care about you
my step nephew a preteen has begun masturbating i also had to take away the internet because he was caught looking up porn im worried about him,your nephews behavior sounds normal and developmentally appropriate  masturbation is a healthy expression of sexuality  most families to create some rules about where its ok to masturbate for example stating that it should be done in the privacy of the childs own room  im wondering if you or another adult in his life have talked to him about his developing sexuality  it seems like that would help him and you handle his increasing maturity
we have tried gentle talking counting to calm her and talking about it sending her to her room and then trying to talk when shes calmer and now calisthenics however nothing is working,theres two things this post relays  one which im sure youve already looked into  is working with the school to address this problem sure sometimes kids dont get along but most schools look at bullying seriously and this sounds serious the other though is additional tools to consider to help your daughter if you havent already read greenes explosive child you might give it a shot while its a little preachy many of the tools are wonderful and can help parents navigate tantrums httpswwwamazoncomexplosivechildunderstandingfrustratedchronicallydp0062270451 another tool that can redirect a child thats losing it is a task if her tantrums say involve throwing things maybe shes in charge of throwing all the sticks and acorns off the driveway into the garbage bin ie hey jenny you seem really angry right now lets use all that energy and get some work done go with her throw with her even  if possible  making a game out of getting the acorns into the bin from a distance i wish you all the best
i am in my 30s with 2 kids and no job and im behind on the bills ive been trying everything with no results i feel like everyone else puts their needs in front on mine i give intil it hurts and im afraid that im going to fail my babies ive been struggling for 5 yrs in a relationship with no communication and no alone time how can i get some support,financial stability is probably a good place to start your new life projectif your partner doesnt work or doesnt contribute his money to the household bills then maybe you are eligible  for some type of stipend from the governmentespecially since you have kids the child welfare service may intervene to help you  sometimes too a partner who is unwilling to pay for their kids wellbeing may be pressured by child welfare to make regular contributions to you and your kidsim glad you are thinking of your needs and those of your kids  this is the philosophy which will show you what road to follow so all three of you are in a secure financial place
i am in my 30s with 2 kids and no job and im behind on the bills ive been trying everything with no results i feel like everyone else puts their needs in front on mine i give intil it hurts and im afraid that im going to fail my babies ive been struggling for 5 yrs in a relationship with no communication and no alone time how can i get some support,i would want to know where do you put your needs often times we show people how to treat us based on how we treat ourselves first identify how to practice good self care which can only happen when you are authentic and real about your needs and desires you cannot pour from an empty cup and must take find the time to explore your purpose in life it may be helpful to seek out additional support to work on your intrapersonal relationship
my daughter was overly tired and throwing a fit at her grandparents house she wanted to come home at midnight and cried screamed said she said she hated her grandma and that she wanted to kill herself we also have a new baby in the house i didnt know if this would contribute to this how should i approach this,you wrote a very full family context w many directions to examinedo you know or can you find out what the grandma and your daughter were doing in the evening of the screaming episodeis it possible the grandma abuses your daughter or tells her scary stories watches scary movies  these are only suggestions of some problem between grandma and your daughteralso ask your daughter directly why she wants to kill herself and what killing herself means  seven year olds dont have a concept of death being a forever condition  seven year olds dont have a sense of future meaning besides likingdisliking them   maybe the new baby is a factor  do you feel this is a factor  trust your intuition to tell you if your daughter is resentful of your new babyeven if she is i doubt a seven year old has the capacity to connect current unhappiness with the intention of a future action including suicide
the birth mother attempted suicide several times while pregnant the adopted mother was terminally ill upon adopting the baby and died when the child was just over one year old the adopted father then remarried to a physically psychologically and emotionally abusive woman the child was placed in foster care at 11 years old what might be the long term effects on an adult with this childhood history,the true answer is no one can really say with certaintythe variables are the way this child absorbs and adjusts to these significant changes in their life  all anyone can do is guess at this point and theres no good reason to guessthe only general certainty is that the adult whom this child becomes will have had a profound encounter with the biggest types of human losses a child can go throughsome people become great teachers therapists and philosophers who have this background  some give up on life and hide away from othersthe best anyone could do who knows this child is to offer love bc this is the greatest guarantee to show there are good people on this earth
my grandsons stepmother sends him to school with a pink barbie backpack as a form of punishment,parents are to teach discipline to children not punishment  punishment is another word for wanting to cause hurt there is a different in discipline and punishment  punishment could have long term affects on a childs self image and growth it can lead to others issues such as bullying from peers as well whatever your grandson has done there is a much better way of getting him to understand that his actions are not acceptable punishment is not one them encourage the stepmother to build a positive relationship with him this way he will learn to respect and trust her his actions would improve she may need to attend a parenting class for blended families
my grandsons stepmother sends him to school with a pink barbie backpack as a form of punishment,absolutely not it is never in a childs best interest to use humiliation as punishment this can lead to issues in the relationship between parent and child as well as the childs social relationships kids have a hard enough time to then go and cause them embarrassment is unconscionable the entire job of a parent is to prepare their child to become a successful healthy adult you do this by using healthy ways to teach a child when they make a mistake discipline shouldnt be seen as punishment it should be seen as a way to teach a lesson what lesson could this possibility be teaching him absolutely nothing meanwhile she is most likely damaging her relationship with him and causing great distress in his school day and peer interactions she should be one of the people he can come to when hes hurting not someone who causes him pain
i am in my early 20s and i still live with my parents because i cant afford to live alone my mother says that if i live under her roof i have to follow her rules she is trying to control my life what should i do,hi  im sorry you are having such a tough time with this situation  i have worked with a number of young adults in their 20s who have had to move back home after college  or even stay at home through the college years  bottom line is that either way  it is so difficult when you are trying to discover who you are and what you want your life to be  to have to live at home  i have even heard much older adults clients  say that when they visit their childhood home  they suddenly feel like a kid again   the old dynamics between adults and their parents and siblings can pop right up as if they have gone back in time and are no longer adults i would suggest that you approach your mom and say something like i am hoping we can talk about the best way for us to manage me living here  i really appreciate that you are giving me a place to live until i get on my feet  and i want to be respectful of you and our home  at the same time  though i feel like its important for me to have more independence than when i was younger because i am growing up and trying to learn more about myself and become more autonomous can we talk about what might be fair rules that we can  both live with  if she is receptive  maybe you can each write a separate list of what you think would be fair and reasonable and then compare lists and try to make compromises and come up with a list of guidleines that feel fair to you both   if this is too hard to do alone  perhaps you and your mom can meet with a therapist a few times who can help you to come  up with some kind of compromise contract  this is not an easy situation  but if you can approach your mom in a calm and mature way and suggest a planned structured discussion that doesnt take place in the heat of the moment  your mom may be impressed by your maturity and even more receptive to working out some rules that you can both live withgood luck elissa gross
i am in my early 20s and i still live with my parents because i cant afford to live alone my mother says that if i live under her roof i have to follow her rules she is trying to control my life what should i do,hello even though legally you are an adult it is a matter of courtesy to respect the homes of your parents as long as you live there you should be considerate of their needs at the same time there should be conversation about what each of you considers appropriate as it pertains to communication between a parent and an adult even though you are still her offspring this will require openness honesty and a willingness to give from both sides in a respectful way healthy boundaries can be established and honored when each is willing to do their part in this new relationship your mother knows you are an adult but has not had as many years of treating you like one so mentally and emotionally this will take some time for her to adapt share your concerns with her and see if you can come up with a set of rules that you both can honor it will be a great stepping stone for both of you as you move into this new chapter together as you begin relating a little differentlyreach out for help to a counselor if needed you dont have to sort this out on your own and lastly take good care of yourself in the process you are moving through some exciting times in your life the more you can have support as you explore new events the better you might feel less stressedwarm regards
i am in my early 20s and i still live with my parents because i cant afford to live alone my mother says that if i live under her roof i have to follow her rules she is trying to control my life what should i do,unfortunately you seem to have yourself in a double bind by living with your mom she is not going to stop her attempts at what you perceive as controlling there is no use in trying to debate or get her to see your point as long as your there and you personalize her attempts at control then you will find yourself frustrated and resentful try to find an extra job or a roommate so that you can do the natural process of moving on outwwwlifecounselingorlandocom
i am in my early 20s and i still live with my parents because i cant afford to live alone my mother says that if i live under her roof i have to follow her rules she is trying to control my life what should i do,unfortunately i think most of us have heard this so you are not alone  if you are still under her roof she has leverage as to what her expectations are while you are living there  i would consider therapy for the both of you to see if there could be a middle ground that could be agreed upon  often times a 3rd party can help with conflict  if there is no resolution then i would look to get creative in finding a place of your own
i am in my early 20s and i still live with my parents because i cant afford to live alone my mother says that if i live under her roof i have to follow her rules she is trying to control my life what should i do,hello it sounds like you and your parents are not balanced in your communication and awareness of expectations your growth is not only reflected in your ability to understand and apply new knowledge and skills it is also reflective of your parents acceptance of your understanding and application have you tried talking with your parents to let them know your concernsthis talking is best when face to face and during non active conflict  cant begin stating rules during an argument etc sometimes it is even helpful to write down ways you feel you can be supported by them and supportive to them maybe share this list or reflective piece with them to review or use when communicating the expectations unfortunately until there are clear expectations stated and expressed the scale will be uneven and frustrations will increase dr t
i am in my early 20s and i still live with my parents because i cant afford to live alone my mother says that if i live under her roof i have to follow her rules she is trying to control my life what should i do,that is a really tough situation that a lot of young people are experiencing right now the first thing to under is that you cant change who your parents are and cannot change their behavior the thing to keep in mind is that you can control your responses and actions  you may need to keep living at home with them for the next few months or years and the best way to do this is to have a plan the second thing is to keep in mind that their controlling behavior is most likely not about based your behavior controlling parents are often driven by their concept of what will keep their children safe and happy unfortunately this is not always accurate but keep in mind it is not a personal attack  there are ways you can deal with controlling parents  and most of them require creating a plan of actionexamples of action plansdecide in advance how youll calmly and rationally respond to your parents when you feel theyre trying to control youarrange to phone a friend or trusted adult when you feel like youre losing controltalk in person to an adult you trust there arent any quick tips on how to deal with parents who want to control you you need to find strategies that are geared to your specific family situation get specific coping tips from books about family dynamics such astoxic parents overcoming their hurtful legacy and reclaiming your life by susan forwardcutting loose an adults guide to coming to terms with your parents by howard halperna counselor can be a good resource and provide support and guidance about issues addressing normal growth and development during periods of transition
i am in my early 20s and i still live with my parents because i cant afford to live alone my mother says that if i live under her roof i have to follow her rules she is trying to control my life what should i do,youre among many millennials who live with their parents due to financial reasonsdoes your mother mean rules pertaining to the way your family household organizes its daily or does she mean something elseevery household needs rules as responsibilities to keep the house clean who does the grocery shopping the way costs are distributed for this and all the other carrying charges  and tasks of maintaining the house in decent order as well as respecting the privacy and noise level requests of others who live in the homethis set of responsibilities applies whenever more than one person lives with another personhave you tried simply telling your mom that youre willing to be a responsible household member and that you prefer to keep the details of the way you live the rest of your life to yourselfthis would show respect to your mom and start the discussion as to the areas of your life you feel deserve privacy and how you would like to handle when your right to run your own life overlaps with any household duties
my dad makes me feel like shit and like im worthless he calls me names and makes me feel depressed i want to move out because i swear if i stay here im going to lose it what can i do,if youre actually able to afford to move out and support your own life then this is a reasonable choiceif youre not in such a position and must continue for a while to live w your dad then emotionally protect yourself from himdoing so is much more difficult than maybe it soundsdo you have privacy in your house and can you spend more time in a selfcreated safe space than around your dadalso limit the amount of dialogue you have with him so you dont offer him a chance to feel invited to criticize youare there other people who live in the household w you and dadif yes then are they similarly called names or are you singled out by him what do the other family members do when they hear your dad calling you namesis it possible the other family members dont realize how hurt and upset you are by your dads behaviorif yes then make a project for yourself to tell the other family members that you suffer from your dads name callingit is possible the other family members will step in and tell your dad to stopnot necessarily that he will stop  knowing the others support you emotionally and find you credible is helpful on its own
my dad makes me feel like shit and like im worthless he calls me names and makes me feel depressed i want to move out because i swear if i stay here im going to lose it what can i do,are you old enough to move out then by all means whats stopping youif not is it possible for you to move in with another family memberif youre a minor cps may need to step in they often do in cases of abuse your safety is the number one priorityits difficult to offer advice without knowing more about your situation but i can say this dont let other people define your self worth you can choose not to allow him to make you feel anything it really is that simple by looking at it as a choice you make you will be empowered to take control over your emotions and learn to feel better about yourself because your selfworth will no longer be defined by what someone else says about you or how they treat youlet me say that again in a different way your selfworth is not defined by someone else the way he treats you is a reflection of who he is as a person  not you dont take ownership of that i understand that if you are a minor setting healthy boundaries and refusing to accept this kind of treatment can be difficult reach out to others for help but if you are 18 and over there is absolutely no excuse for you to be there having to put up with maltreatment put up some boundaries and create the distance needed to protect yourself emotionally you owe it to yourself and deserve to live a healthy happy life anyone who tells you otherwise is wrong
i want to live with my mom my dad gets angry and makes me feel like everything is my fault i still talk to my mom although my dad tells me that im no allowed to im scared i will make the wrong decision and that my dad will hate me how do i tell him that i want to live with my mom,yes from what you wrote your dad doesnt accept responsibility for the way he feels and blames you for his feelingsim glad you recognize hes handling himself less as a grown person and more like a young childi also understand your hurt and frustration that your father handles himself in a way which shows for now that he is unwilling to respect your wishesyour decision is not surprising since most people wouldnt want to live with a parent who shows little interest to respect their kids decisionsin terms of how to tell him your choice do this in simple and most basic information terms  ive decided for now to live w momi suggest to not offer reasons to him bc he doesnt seem interested in hearing them  giving him reasons would likely trigger him to rebut themif he asks questions answer them as simply as possibleif and when you feel he is more willing to understand and know you then youd feel more free to have genuine dialogue with himright now he doesnt seem very ready to handle this
i want to live with my mom my dad gets angry and makes me feel like everything is my fault i still talk to my mom although my dad tells me that im no allowed to im scared i will make the wrong decision and that my dad will hate me how do i tell him that i want to live with my mom,there is a lot of information that needs to be filled in first so what the custody arrangement does your dad have full custody is the custody shared what does your mom think about the situation is she willing to go to bat for youwhat is your age usually you have the right to choose based on age requirements set by the statelegally you cant be kept away from your mom unless there is some legal complications that prevent itis your father abusive and should you seek protectionmany details need to be filled inyou can seek counseling without your parents approving or knowing depending on your agefind counseling through school or local agenciesyou have rights and one of those is the right to choose
i have three children a biological daughter a stepdaughter and a stepson i found out my stepdaughter overdosed today my daughter blames me i told her to stay out of it im scared of all three kids now they all blame me for their choices they made all three have drug addictions i had a stroke in 2013 so i need to depend on people from now on,blaming others is one of our greatest coping mechanisms  it is not just for addiction and often we blame the ones closest to us  you can not stop them from blaming you you can stop yourself for taking on the burden  we are all in charge of the choices we make  no one makes us do something other than our self  we choose how we internalize and react to situations  i would find a good therapist who understands family dynamics and addiction to help you cope with your current environment and help you move forward
she refuses to talk to me and told my mom her grand mother that she is remembering things from the past i dont know what to do my daughter blames me and swears she hates me my parents say i should just let my daughter live with her dad but i dont see how i could fix things if i only see her every other weekend what should i do,sorry to hear about your high degree of stresshow old is your daughterwho abused yours daughterthe answers make a difference to your decisionobviously if the father was the abuser then unless your ex demonstrates to you and you believe he will not abuse her your daughter should stay with youif someone other than the father was the abuser and the father has a good relationship with your daughter then it is possible that the time away from your household will give each of you time away from arguing with one anotherwhat does your daughter tell you she wantsher wishes must be considered toorelationships can be fixed  sometimes being apart helps this process because the two people each have time to reflect more deeply on what they value about the other
shes a teenager and for the last two years shes lived with her older brother shes angry because she wants to come live with me but my current living situation is not the best for her she refuses to see any reason shes being disrespectful her sexual curiosity is waking up,youre her mom and she needs you  i would suggest focusing on connection  since you are not currently living together one way to do this would be to plan a date in which she gets to decide what you do together  give her time to think about what she wants to do  as long as the activity is safe and affordable try to do it even if its not your thing  while you are with her turn off the phone and give her your undivided attention  the goal would be just for you to enjoy each other and connect
i told her that if daddy dies we will never see him again she started crying because i wouldnt make her daddy die,children often have a difficult time expressing emotions accurately it is also very likely that your daughter does not understand  the permanence of death having said that she is using some very specific ideas here and i would recommend contacting a local mental health professional with some experience working with childreni would also wonder where she is getting this idea sometimes children hear things on tv or from an adult and we are not even aware of how much they are rememberingit may be helpful to teach her things that she can do when she is angry like say that she is mad because she cannot have the toy that she is asking forim curious as to how long it is that she stays mad like this and whether she talks to her dad after she is no longer angry does she say the same sorts of things about youit may also be helpful for you to work with a mental health professional possibly the same one who is working with your daughter so that you can have some support with this as well
i told her that if daddy dies we will never see him again she started crying because i wouldnt make her daddy die,toddlers dont have the intellectual capacity to conceptualizebetter to find out why she wants daddy to die than explain the future consequences of death to your toddlera person must be around 9 possibly 8 years old before absorbing the potential effects of an action taken in present timepretty much your toddler demonstrated to you here age appropriate and limited understanding of the loss of a parent by crying that you werent able to magically make her father disappearalso please pay attention and form your own opinions as to the reasons why your toddler would wish her fathers deathshe may be pointing out that the father behaves in frightening or harmful ways towards her
i told her that if daddy dies we will never see him again she started crying because i wouldnt make her daddy die,its normal for a child to be so angry she wanted someone to die but this seems to be heading into a dangerous realm i think it would be wise to have her seen by a child psychologist just to rule out anything more serious

my husbands exwife married a man who was charged with seven felony counts of pandering involving a minor he by his own admission is addicted to child pornography my stepdaughters are now all teenagers they do not know my husbands exwife has kept this information from my stepdaughters the stepfather has had issues regarding his pornography addiction recently the exwife minimizes it by saying that he has repented it is a constant strain on my husband knowing that his girls are living with a man who is addicted to child pornography my own therapist believes the girls should be told the exwife says her therapist says the opposite,lorain youre correct that your husbands exwife is seriously minimizing this problem i have a very strong opinion here in my book the safety of children trumps potentially insulting or hurting the feelings of adults of course the girls should be told because they have the right to know their voice is not the only one im concerned about here though i believe your husband has the right to insist that his daughters be in a safe home and there is clear evidence this man is not safe this woman is putting her own comfort she simply doesnt want to deal with her partners situation her own fears or anyone elses needs above the safety of two vulnerable girls honestly if it was me my kids wouldnt be even visiting that home with that man present repented or not its not worth the risk if she decides to stay with him the natural consequence of having a known perpetrator in your home is not having access to vulnerable children in that same home
her father and i have been dealing with this problem for quite some time now she is an adolescent and the problem is mostly food she is now overweight and we just dont know what to do anymore she can be disrespectful and doesnt listen to or respect what we say,i would be curious about there potentially being some emotional or physical trauma in your daughters history that she is struggling with physical trauma is usually easier to identify but emotional trauma can be feeling a lack of emotional connection in her important relationships having experienced bullying or some other emotional injury the fact that there are some defiance symptoms going on suggests that she might be in need of a safe place to process what shes going through and the potential issue with control or meeting emotional needs with food is also concerning i would recommend looking for a therapistcounselor who works with childrenadolescents in the area of addressing trauma for an assessment they may be able to ask the right questions to see whether trauma is truly the issue
can a counselor take sides with one parent and allow a parent to order the child to tell the counselor every detail about what happened during the other parents visitation in order to help build a case for child custody,i see a few issues herefirst the age of the child is important if the child is considered an adult by state law with regard to counseling states differ on this  the range is typically between age 13 and age 18 no one is allowed to be in the session without the childs consentsecond ethical and legal standards generally require that a counselor be in the role of a therapist or in the role of an evaluator but not both this means that a counselor should not generally provide both counseling and offer an opinion regarding who should have custody of a childthird knowing the details of any parenting plan or separation agreement is important generally either parent can consent to counseling for a minor child and can be present during the childs sessions if a court order parenting plan or separation agreement specifies that one of the parents has sole decision making authority then only that parent can consent to counseling for the minor child and only that parent can be present during the childs sessionsin a situation like this i would strongly recommend seeking out legal advice specific to your state law
he is an adolescent he has peed his pant multiple times over the last few years all at times when he is too wrapped up in a video game or video we have taken away games and videos for long periods of time as punishment but after a few months of having then back he pees his pants again,sounds as though your son is pissed off about somethingpunishment will most likely result in more of the same not less of the peeing you would like to stop from happeninglaziness is more of a social judgement than it is a characteristic of its own meritis this your description of your son or his description of himselffirst step always before addressing any of the family dynamics emotions and psychology of the people involved is a medical rule out as to why your son pees at times he plays video gamesif he has medical clearance that there is no physiological  problem then talk with your son on his opinions as to why he pees if he is aware of the urge to pee and ignores it or that his attention gets so absorbed he doesnt notice the urge to peesee what modifications you can create by cooperating with your sonmaybe it is as simple as each two hours he sets a timer and when it goes off he takes a bathroom break
he is an adolescent he has peed his pant multiple times over the last few years all at times when he is too wrapped up in a video game or video we have taken away games and videos for long periods of time as punishment but after a few months of having then back he pees his pants again,from a behavioral standpoint you should refrain from punishing your son  instead of utilizing punishment when he wets himself provide contingencies prior to any accidents  sit down with your son and discuss the importance of utilizing the bathroom and responsibilities and inform him that if he chooses to wet his pants that his video games will not be available for use for him the next dayor your designated realistic time frame  this way if an accident occurs no heated words have to be exchanged because you have already laid the ground work  also allow him to clean up himself  gather cleaning supplies and and oversee cleaning operations without ridicule or negative feedback  since you have stated that you have an adolescent who is experiencing enuresis you may want to check with your pcp and a licensed professional for underlying diagnosis that can be treated  you can also call a local behavioral analyst
is this something i should be worried about should i do something about it,it can be tricky to figure out if a child is truly satisfied with his lack of friendships parents can usually tell when their child is happy but kids who are unhappy may be masking disappointment perhaps acting out their feelings in an aggressive manner others may internalize symptoms appearing sad or withdrawn a parent may learn a great deal by asking the teachers questions such as whether the child works with others on group projects or if he eats lunch alone a parent can also talk with the recess supervisor about what happens on the playground and whether your child stays on the sidelines of play unsure of how to join the group therespectfully is a difference between kids who are shy but happy and kids who feel isolated because they do not know how to make friends itis not necessarily that there is something wrong with that child but they will in fact need help and suggestions for breaking into a peer group ask a child if there is someone he would like to have over to play if a mom or dad can make the play dates happen or if they hit on an activity the child truly enjoys the young person may begin to forge friendships on their own i encourage wellmeaning parents to choose words carefully use phrases like hey i noticed something or let me help you be successful by showing respect parents should feel more comfortable nudging their children beyond their comfort zonewhen to seek professional help when does isolation raise a red flag for longterm issues true personality disorders are not typically diagnosed until adulthood still professional counseling should be considered if the antisocial behavior is causing the child significant distress perhaps keeping him from functioning in everyday activities also parents should pay attention to how the childs social behavior changes over time such as social anxiety the vast majority of children who define quality time as time alone are perfectly happy healthy and normal if the child is able to nurture at least one friendship exhibiting what experts call social reciprocity then parents can relax and can cherish that child who enjoys the pleasure of his or her own company
is this something i should be worried about should i do something about it,my son plays alone at recessis this something i should be worried about should i do something about itevery mom is the expert on their childrens behavior first of all i suggest checking with your son asking him if he is happy while playing alone or does he complain that no one wants to play with him does he plays alone in school but is social in other environments with family or neighborsplaying alone is healthy for children it helps them to be independent and confident it allows them to explore their environment and use their imagination among other benefits  on the other hand it is also important to develop social skills early on and become confident in our skills as we grow children go through stages of exploration until they develop a sense of œsocial confidence depending on your sons age he might need some input or advice provide the opportunity to interact with other children without pushing it take him to the park to play with a friend or to childrens activities in your neighborhood  later ask him what did he thought of the activity and if he enjoyed playing there children also follow their parents model so you can encourage social interaction by greeting other and asking your son to do the same ask him to receive the guests who come to the house with you and sit to enjoy the conversation if you notice any shakiness becoming tearful anxious or aggressive when approaching social encounters you may want to talk to the school counselor or childrens therapist to evaluate those symptoms and rule out any behavioral problems or social anxietymi hijo juega solo en el recesodeberãa preocuparme al respecto deberãa hacer algo al respectocada mama es experta en la conducta de sus hijos  primero que nada te sugiero que revises con tu hijo y le preguntes si ãl se siente contento jugando solo o si se queja porque nadie quiere jugar con ãl  observa si ãl juega solo en la escuela pero es sociable en otros ambientes como con la familia o los vecinos jugar solo puede ser saludable para los niãos les ayudo a ser independientes desarrollan sentido de seguridad y les permite explorar su ambiente y utilizar su imaginaciã³n entre otros beneficiospor otro lado tambiãn es importante desarrollar destrezas sociales y perfeccionarlas con la prãctica  los niãos van por etapas de exploraciã³n y prueba hasta que desarrollan un nivel de confianza en sus destrezas sociales dependiendo de la edad de tu hijo puede que el necesite algunos consejos provãele la oportunidad de interactuar con otros niãos sin obligarlo ya sea yendo al parque a jugar con vecinos o a actividades comunitarias infantiles con algãºn amigo luego pregãºntale como le pareciã³ la actividad y si le gusto compartir allã  tambiãn recuerda que los niãos siguen el modelo de sus padres asã que puedes motivarlo invitãndolo a que salude a otros despuãs de ti o invitãndolo a recibir a la visita que llega a la casa y que los acompaãe durante la conversaciã³nsi observas que tu hijo estã nervioso lloroso o agresivo cuando se acerca alguna actividad social consulta con el consejero escolar o un consejero infantil para evaluar sus sãntomas y descarta cualquier problema de conducta o ansiedad
is this something i should be worried about should i do something about it,i recommend asking your son about the reasons he chooses to play alone at recess if he is happy on his own and you know he has some friends i would not be very concerned however there may be bullying going on at school in the case of bullying it may be a situation where you as his parent will need to step in
is this something i should be worried about should i do something about it,humans are social creatures so this can be an alarming thing for a parent to deal with just like adults children are not the same and some children are more social than others if he plays alone at recess all the time it would worry myself as well however recess is only one domain of life does he have friends outside of school or daycare does he socialize in other situations or is it just at recess where this occurs if this is a global problem occurring at other social times it may be indicative of something deeper going on if perhaps it is occurring just during recess it could be something else altogether i would request reports from all teachers and caregivers concerning socialization and make a choice on whether or not to evaluate furtherhope this helpsc
is this something i should be worried about should i do something about it,the answer depends on how the other areas of your sons life are doingis he happy or does he seem happy playing alone during recessdoes he have friends in other social circles besides the students whom hes with at recesshow is his academic progresshow is his social integration among his classmatesare there any special or unusual circumstances in the home and family environmentgo through this list to form a fuller idea of whether your son simply likes alone time and takes this option during recess or if any if the above areas show stress or difficulty for him and which need to be further understood and handled
me and my adult daughter just do not get along shes very belittling to me when i dont agree with her its almost like she scolds me we get into all out war shes said i dont support her in what she does and that ive never loved her she calls me horrible names and she pushes my buttons to the point i call her names,as frustrating and probably hurtful as your daughters comments sound theres also a message in them about how she genuinely feelsto some degree your daughter and you may both feel similarly misunderstood by the otherdeveloping ways of listening and talking to one another to better understand how you each feel would probably help a lotone major point to be aware is that the motherdaughter relationship dynamic because it is strong may slow the new dynamic of relating as two adultswatch for your own tendency to expect your daughter to consider you as a parenting authority instead of considering her as a grown personthe same is true of your daughter  she may need to remind herself to talk to you as the adult she isher needs from you are real they just need to be spoken to you in an adult way
we are the legal guardianship of our grandson he has been acting out and he wants to talk to his mom that has not talked to him since before last year how are we to handle this,hi boone this depends a lot on his age and the situation the younger the child is in general the more i would see this as your decision not his a child of any age should be listened to carefully about these matters but just because a child has unresolved issues about a parent doesnt necessarily mean that having contact is a good solution some questions was the parent harmful to the child is the parent likely to be harmful to the child how likely is it to be a positive experience do you have any contact with the parent you may want to speak with the parent first to determine whether they are in a stable enough place to allow this to happen  i would start by asking the child more about what is on his mind what does he want to get out of a visit with the parent is it to see them and know the parent is okay to get an apology to apologize for a perceived hurt to have regular contact to find out if they are loved what does he hope mom or dad might do or say in the visit there are many possible goals this child might have in mind this will give you a sense of whats missing for the child what need are they trying to fill once you know the need try to determine the likelihood of that need being met successfully through contactonce you determine the risk of the childs need not being met then you decide whether it makes sense  the older the child the more able they are to determine this with you or for themselves there are other options than a facetoface he can write to his mom or dad text or email its likely that the child is looking for a sense that he is loved wanted worth some effort when a child is separated from a parent they tend to blame themselves whether he sees the parent or not he will need extra love attention and support than a child who has two loving present parents i wish him the best and im grateful for the love and support you continue to give your grandson youre very special
i am divorced and happily remarried our blended family of children are in their 20s my youngest age 20 continues to call me crazy and favors her dad he was abusive to me and i left with injuries he never wanted kids and i did he paid child support only through forced wage earners now my daughters favor him after all the sacrifices i made for them the past 15 years as a single mom i dont deny them a relationship with their dad but to be called crazy and then watch them hang out with him hurts me to the very core im not sure how to handle this,hi arkansas your situation sounds like a case of parental alienation your expartner unfortunately has the power to say things to your children that poison their relationship with you its a form of woman abuse and child abuse hes likely doing this to hurt you and have power over you and hes not considering how its affecting the kids ive seen this happen in many families parents who once had a strong loving relationship with their children suddenly feel abandoned in favor of the other parent in some cases children actually stop having contact with one parent who is left bewildered and powerless its your exs job to support your relationship with your kids not try to destroy it while you cant change his behaviours and i think you know that there are things you can do for yourself and your kids for your children you can refuse to enter into the war hes setting up hes trying to provoke you into acting crazy but you dont have to fall for this if you run around screaming hes lying it only makes you look more crazy try to stay calm and dont put their dad down to them no matter how tempting it is one day they may be ready to hear the truth of your relationship with their father but wait until they ask trust that they have their own experience of their dad and trust that he doesnt have the power to destroy their love for you children in the long term lose respect for parents who denigrate the other parent they see who their dad is already id bet but they dont know how to cope with that if hes the only one fighting a war youre helping them feel less trapped in a parental conflict dont engage on his level dont blame your children completely although i have to say that for them to call you names like crazy is not acceptable and you dont need to tolerate that disrespect try to deal with this behaviour without bringing their dad into it they are acting out their fathers agenda likely because they instinctively see his weakness children often support the weaker parent rather than abandon them you get the worst because they trust your love but you can still have boundaries letting them abuse you isnt the answer but have compassion for their position this picture isnt their fault but as adults they can be held accountable for their choicesreassure yourself that you are the mom you know you are you dont need them to gush all over you in order to know that you made sacrifices hold onto the likelihood that some day they will come back and be grateful it may take a while you cant rush it but they will see you for who you are your power is in giving them a consistently calm generous connected supportive mom who refuses to play games or be walked on id recommend trying to connect with other parents who experience this phenomenon or a therapist who can reinforce these goals and help keep you grounded good luck

we live with my expartners sister and her husband we have been there for five years now they are hispanic and talk to my daughter in their language sometimes they overstep their balance between aunt and uncle and reach into my role as a parent they neglect to see this i do and it reflects in my childs behavior she sees them as stable but is upset that her dad isnt here and my intuition tells me she blames me to a degree because she doesnt know about his alcohol addictions,hi new york im happy to hear that your daughter doesnt know about her dads addictions although you dont say how old she is and i imagine that at some point in her life she will be ready to know the truth i trust your instinct that now is not the time your ability to have clear boundaries about what is adult conversation and what is suitable for a child to know are really important here and i can tell youre being appropriately protective and a thoughtful parent as much as this helps your daughter i sense that you also know you cant take away the emotional pain that comes from having an absent parent children tend to blame themselves for a parents absence these children need extra love and support wherever they can get ityou say that you feel like there is a wedge between you and your daughter i understand that having your ex partners relatives in the same home would make it uncomfortable at times it is very important to establish boundaries only you should parent your daughter but its also natural for people to want to assist you lets trust that their intentions are good if there is no evidence to the contrary as much as they support you they also  have emotional ties to your daughters father while there is potential for discomfort in this complex situation there are also many positive factors here that i invite you to seei dont know what your culture is but for your daughter to have the opportunity to preserve her fathers heritage language and a relationship with his family are potentially wonderful additions to her life in general the more adults around loving and supporting a child the better it could be that you are feeling threatened by small moments where there appears to be a special connection between your daughter and her fathers family nothing anyone else does can take your daughters love from you my hope for you is that you can feel so secure in your own position as loving mother that you will not feel intimidated by other positive connections your daughter has they are potentially wonderful connections and she deserves your support in maintaining those relationships if they dont harm heri suggest that the most important alliances to work on here are between you and your exs family if you could all give your daughter the gift of a healthy united supportive and loving safety net for herthats the best outcome of all
my brother just broke up with his girlfriend while they were dating for the past two years her son spent the weekends with me and my mother now she doesnt think her son should have any interaction with us how should we approach the situation is she doing the right thing for her child,hi tampa i get that this is a loss for all of you you have bonded with this child as a result of the significant time you have spent with him hes a lucky boy to have had you all taking care of him certainly it seems that his mother might not be making the best decision for her son if you are willing to maintain the relationship it would be good for him to still have that contact in my book the more people loving a child the better but ultimately she has the right to make these decisions to oppose her wont likely do any good you can focus on grieving this relationship and supporting your brother through his loss as well
my motherinlaw is mentally ill she has been for most of her life she cuts herself she has been in and out of psychiatric hospitals for about 40 years she has voices in her head that tell her to cut herself she has had multiple shock therapy treatments and shes on enough medication to take down an elephant her parental rights for her two children were taken away from her when my husband was a boyhe is now in his late 30s she doesnt even have custody of herself she hasnt asked yet but she has been insinuating that she wants to babysit my child how do i go about saying no without creating an issue,hi fontanathanks for providing all the details needed in order to respond to your question it seems very clear to me that no would be the appropriate response i like your healthy boundaries and ill help you explore possible ways to respond to her first she hasnt asked yet and you dont know that she will right now you can pleasantly ignore her hints theyre not hurting you and if you ignore them theyre more likely to go away you can address and reduce your own anxiety about the possibility of her asking by reassuring yourself that you have the right as parents to make this decision and that if shes offended that doesnt mean that youre being mean it means that she has unrealistic expectations so the first goal is to put it out of your mind as a worry you might never have to face that moment but i understand that you want to be preparedas her son perhaps your husband is the best one to answer the question should it ever come is he willing to do this but if you are comfortable and if youre the one she asks you can confidently give her a simple honest response about why it wont happen and i would suggest presenting a firmly closed door rather than saying but maybe later no need to apologize or hum and hawwe love that you want to be around junior and we definitely want you in hisher life try to leave out the but here youre not in a healthy place and were not comfortable with you caring for himher on your ownif she pushes the issue this is evidence of her denial or inappropriate boundaries id let her know that its not negotiable that you understand if shes disappointed but youre not open to discussing the issue really theres nothing to discuss learning not to take responsibility for her emotions is part of having an ill person in your life i wish you the best
my daughter didnt see her biological father for the last three years she doesnt want to see him because she remember really bad things from him such as domestic violence and child abuse the visitation is with supervision but she refuses to see him is it better to take my daughter to the therapist and try to see him after the therapy,has the father or the visitation supervisor contacted you regarding why your daughter hasnt shown up for the past three years worth of supervised visitationor is the supervised visitation a new development for the bio dad and your daughterif no one is pressuring or expecting your daughter to show up no one has even asked where she is why she isnt present then i dont see any reason for you to offer more effort by your daughter than the father is willing to make for seeing herif your daughter is willing to talk with a therapist then let her find out first hand if the sessions seem useful or notthe one move id avoid is to force your daughter to go to a therapist since growing up in a household in which child abuse took place being forced may remind her of her own feelings from this past of feeling no one heard or cared about the way she wanted to be treated
my daughter didnt see her biological father for the last three years she doesnt want to see him because she remember really bad things from him such as domestic violence and child abuse the visitation is with supervision but she refuses to see him is it better to take my daughter to the therapist and try to see him after the therapy,hi dillonim from canada so i dont know the laws in your state it depends on that a good deal perhaps in my opinion a child should never be forced into a situation where they feel unsafe even if it is supervised if the child is old enough to make a strong statement about not wanting to see a parent then this should be honoured unfortunately the laws dont always uphold a parents right to do what is best for their child i recommend you see a lawyer who will advise you about how to proceed without putting yourself at risk of breaching custody agreementsif you feel your daughter can benefit from therapy that is a separate question or is she already in therapy a family therapist will typically meet with you alone first in order to determine if therapy is a wise move for your child it isnt always appropriate
my fiancã and i have been in a relationship for two years we have an infant son my fiancã also has a child from a previous relationship we do not live together i live with my mother currently while i get on my feet and hes living with some friends my mother and i have an awful relationship that is completely unbearable most of the time we cannot even stand to be around one another while living in the same house she has made it clear that she wants me gone recently i was talking to my father who lives in a different state my father and i have always had a good relationship i explained to him the situation i am in with my mother and he said he would like for me my fiancã and our son to come live with him and his wife i would really love to go i do not want my son to be in this environment with constant arguing and negativity any longer there is nowhere else for me to stay while remaining in this state the problem is my fiancã is refusing to move away with me because he does not want to leave behind his other child he and his childs mother have a horrible relationship and she would absolutely not be willing to let him visit if we moved away i believe i would be doing what is best for my child by moving away but i do not want to leave without my fiancã i have already explained the situation to him and he will not give in do i continue to stay in this negative environment with my child and keep our family together do i move away with my child and have my relationship end i do not want to take him out of either of his kids lives what do i do,hi bethlehemyou have a big decision to make  i appreciate your fiancãs need to stay close to his child and be a standup dad and i am glad that you know your son needs an emotionally safe placeim a bit confused because the obvious answer seems to be that you and your fiancã would get your own place together i get that you want your dad to take care of all of you but maybe its time to take responsibility for your own future and start building it independently of either parent i say that without knowing how old you are but if you have a child and a two year relationship you basically have declared your independence anyway  i wish you the best
just wondering if this is a deviant act and if i should be concerned for him he isnt quite 10,well its certainly unusual and potentially could be cause for alarm its a passive aggressive act if done intentionally so i would wonder if this child is trying to say somethingi think without any context however or sense of whether there are other signs of disturbance its impossible to say whats going on if there are other signs of distress or very unusual behaviours you might bring the child to someone who can assess him properly
my boyfriend has a child he gets every other weekend he goes to see her twice a week or more every time she leaves he gets into these funks like when his mom died when shes here shes disrespectful and his answer is œwell i dont know what to tell you she swears and talks back and he laughs he and her mom have been apart for three years and he blames her behavior on that and her being so young we never have adult time when shes not here shes the golden child and he wont listen to anyone,hi lockport building a relationship when there are already children involved is very tricky you dont tell us whether you live together or not if you do your position is perhaps more difficult because his daughters behaviours affect you you live in the home a bottom line for me is you dont tell someone else how to parent thats for your boyfriend to decide when hes there hes the parent and he makes the decisions about how she is disciplined or not even if you have good ideas or you completely disagree or you think you see something that hes not seeing its simply not for you to interfere there it sounds like your boyfriend is struggling emotionally and needs support he has had a lot of losses in his life and maybe every time his daughter leaves he feels powerless and abandoned do you talk about these things can you find that line of supporting him but not telling him what to doalthough i suggest you leave the parenting to him what you can do is tell him what you see offer suggestions if hes open to it and talk about the ways in which the situation affects you it makes sense to say i see you struggling and i dont know how to help ive noticed that you seem afraid to discipline her are you aware that its coming across this way do you need help or i feel sad and frustrated when we dont spend any time alone together you sound a bit resentful of his daughter is it possible that your real struggle is about whether youre ready to be in a relationship with a man whose priority is his childyou have a voice and its great to offer support and ideas and let him know how you feel ultimately however you are wise to accept this man as who he is and accept the situation for what it is and make your own decision about whether you want to be a part of it 
my exhusband told my two adolescents that santa doesnt exist on the day before christmas they are desperate to hold on to the magic of christmas but i dont know if its right for me to lie to them and tell them that santa is real i dont want to let them down and make them lose out on those memories but i also dont want to lose their trust,well boise the cats out of the bag now isnt it i love that you want to help your kids keep the magic of christmas they must want that too if they still believe in santa into their teen years which is unusual i believe i wonder if they had already figured it out anywaybut they know now and your ex had the right to tell them if he felt it was best so its time to explain to them what a loving and magical thing it is that parents do and christmas can still be magical in so many ways really who says they have to stop believing in santa santa is very real as a spirit of surprise generosity and love
for the last year my adolescent son and daughter have been driving me nuts with fighting im at my wits end how can i get them to stop and get along,that is a good question unfortunately there is no generic answer with this one kids fight for different reasons  wanting attention wanting respect feeling jealous wanting space and to be left alone or a whole bunch of other reasons regardless of the underlying motivations for fighting most conflicts result from misunderstandings and assumptions about the motivations of others and one of the best ways to start figuring out what is going on is to sit them down and have some conversations with them these conversations should be centred on getting a better understanding of why they are angry with each other and really understanding them it is important that they each know that you are committed to understanding their experience rather than simply sitting them down and lecturing them about what they are doing wrong the more they are able to understand each other and feel understood the more likely they will be cooperative and considerate of each other one exercise for doing this that can be very helpful is active listening where one person speaks and the other person reflects back what they heard the other person say and then checks for understanding this is hard to do but it often illuminates where the misunderstandings and assumptions are if this doesnt work it may be time to get a family therapist or counsellor involved who can help facilitate dialogue and resolve conflict
my toddler is having a real hard time with toilet training he almost throws up every time he sees his poop he gags and will not go on the toilet we have tried a toilet chair and ring that goes on the bigboy toilet but he refuses to use it when he sits on the toilet he just sits there forever and only will pee he holds the poop in until he get up and then will poop in his diaper i dump his diaper in the toilet and let him know that it is where it goes to try to encourage him how can i help him get over this fear and passed the stress,your son is showing signs that hes just not ready to be toilet trained you dont say how old he is so im not sure whether the problem is deeper but right his fears may reflect that right now he is simply be not ready to take that step pushing him at this point could worsen the problem so i suggest pulling back the expectations waiting a month or two looking for more signs of readiness and trying again in general teaching children to use the toilet works best when mistakes are handled calmly and when parents pay close attention to cues that the child is responding positively

tonight my husband seemed to put our son down through an incorrect approach his approach was perfectly wrong i found myself defending my son i told him that what he did was not the way to encourage our son instead of watching my husbands harsh behavior i decided to sit beside my son and together we worked on his science assignment in order to encourage him to study my husband got upset and he was swearing at me he threatened me i knew that he was not joking his words scared me a lot,i have had these many cases but in situations like this if it does get out of hand the police do need to be involved sit down and talk to your husband when he is calm and collective
she was raised by her abusive father and his wife 30 years ago i shot and killed my rapist and was convicted in louisiana i lost custody of my daughter and served 5 years when i was released she was 5 and didnt remember me many many sad memories came from my having to leave her visit after visit having to leave her in texas to travel back to louisiana she doesnt remember that i do over the years i thought we had developed a close mother daughter relationship she gave me good reason to doubt that on several occasions but especially last year i have been cruel to her verbally and to my son who i met years after giving him up for adoption last night i was angry at the world and afraid of god i drank and cussed out a maintenance worker for not doing his job 4 months running now im not only feeling guilty for that but afraid of being evicted now help,was either parent abusive or violent toward youyou sound to have suffered emotionally in your relationships since early in lifeone point to consider is to strive for moderation in what you offer in relationshipsa lot of what youve lived through is extreme either as victim or perpetratorif you imagine that apologizing to the custodian for the way spoke to him would calm him down do soat the very least youll be actively resolving your guilt over cussing at him and fear of his retaliation

what makes my step child an 8 year old boy choke my daughter a 6 year old girl this has been going on for 4 years the boy tells my daughter not to tell on him he knows its wrong we have did time out spanking taking away toys and sitting on the wall i am afraid for my daughters safety,i can see why you are alarmed that is a scary situation for a parent do you know if the child has been evaluated by a mental health professional early treatment is often the key a professional will be able to help the child learn how to control their anger and mend the troublesome actions into more appropriate responses have you addressed your concerns with the childs other parent there could be contributing factors in his life that could be causing these issues exposure to violence sexualphysical abuse drug use stressful events in his life etc it is important that these factors are identified so that they can either be eliminated andor reduced i wouldnt hesitate to have him evaluated if he hasnt been already and to ensure that he is getting the help that he needs whether it be medication andor therapy until then i would make sure that he is always supervised under an adults care
all my friends have either hooked up or had a girlfriend but me i try to be happy for them but i get really upset every time they hook up,if you mean œhooked up as having sex with no care for the person and youd like a girlfriend then realize relationships require more complex alignment with a partner than being a sex buddypay attention to all your feelings toward a girl so that youll approach someone who attracts you for reasons in addition to sexual allurealso the process of knowing someone takes much more time than only to sleep with someonehave patience and kindness toward yourself while you get to know the qualities which attract you to a potential girlfriend
im always told im not good enough or trying hard enough i put 100 in to every thing im worn out ive worked on all of my family relationships im doing great in school im kind to those in need and otherwise i stick to my religious beliefs and leave room for mistakes and learn from others so i dont have to make as many and the ones i do i learn from somehow its still not good enough and nothing i do works nothing has changed and i feel hopeless any suggestions or ideas,hello and let me say first what a great question there are so many people putting forth their 100 everyday and often times do not get the credit they deserve without being able to fully understand where youre question is coming from i think there are a couple of different ways to look at this questionfirst i think its important for us to consider the message being sent by those in your life stating that youre not good enough is that actually what they said or is this just what you heard sometimes because of our own selfdoubts and fears we skew and misinterpret the messages we receive from others again listen to the message being sent and attempt to remain objective is the message being sent coming from a place of love or concern if so have an honest and open communication with that individual about what your concerns are regarding the amount of energy and time youre spending on being good enough explore with them how you feel your already giving your bestif the person is unwilling to work at understanding this concern you have then it may be time to explore the relationship some relationships we engage in can be toxic especially if the other person is toxic it may be they have their own stuff going on and they feel the need to constantly put others down to make themselves feel better if youre in the direct path of this individual then it serves to reason you will probably be in the direct fire as well explore whether or not you want this relationship to continue in your life if its a relationship that must continue then work on what you will do to distance yourself from their toxicity or their problems until theyre willing to work on these issues for themselves then it may be necessary to find an exit strategy such as leaving the room or simply refusing to engage in the conversation another perspective of this question is exploring the reason why its important for you to satisfy the expectations of these other individuals no one will ever be 100 good enough for everyone every single person has their own set of expectations in themselves and expectations in others it would be impossible to satisfy all of those expectations for every single person in our lives the question becomes what is it within you that feels the need to meet these expectations there is most likely a part of you yourself as an individual that feels less than and feels as if you yourself are not good enough it then becomes impossible to every feel good enough for others because its really you youre trying to feel good enough for if you already feel as if youre doing everything you can do to be at your best version of yourself then really work on letting go of the rest no one is perfect and striving for perfection in our lives only creates more anxiety and stress find a middle ground in which you are happy with your accomplishments and your daily goals and learn to let go of whats left after all tomorrow is a new day and you can work on more of your goals tomorrowi recommend doing this by finding a mantra a statement or phrase you can repeat to yourself anytime you start to feel that sense of stress and pressure from striving for perfection the mantra can remind you to let go of this expectation you have for yourself or that others have for you so you can also let go of the stress and anxiety surrounding the expectation i leave you with one of my favorite quotes that perhaps you can use as your mantra no one can make you feel inferior without your consent   eleanor roosevelt

my grandma had a stroke and passed away recently i lost my home and job im looking but havent found a job ive been binge watching television and binge eating,helloi write to respond to your recent inquiry for possible increase in selfesteem and positive behavioral change regarding motivation for a new job first of all please try to allow yourself some time for grief of the loss of your dear grandmother it appears you were close to her in many ways and she had a great influence in your life the grief process of anger denial despair and acceptance may be a part of what is keeping you feeling stuck in a cycle of not feeling motivated to find work at this time  perhaps your mind is constantly fighting this grief death can be a traumatic experience for some people and is considered a great loss thus the grief process may continue to be a part of your world for a time but hopefully not keep you stuck on a longterm basis  i would try to reach out to a counselor to discuss this grief process at a deeper level to discern whether her death is part of why you feel this way  grief and loss can also have an effect on your selfesteem  can you begin to see how this cycle is what you may be experiencing one positive i see is that you are continuing to look for a new job  take time to give yourself some credit for the  time you are spending looking for work  also i would recommend you set some shortterm goals first for example make a list of 510 potential new employers and send them each your resume then followup the next week with an email or phone call to make sure the hiring manager or human resources received your resume and have any questions  it is also a good idea to ask for informational interviews in order to get your foot in the door so to speaki hope that this information is helpful to you  please let me know if you have any questions or concernswarmlydenise
my grandma had a stroke and passed away recently i lost my home and job im looking but havent found a job ive been binge watching television and binge eating,wow you got hit with some serious stuff all at once work relationships and housingsecurity are major needs for us and to lose all that at once has got to affect you when things go wrong it is natural for us to look for blameand the easiest person for us to blame is ourselves put that with grief and youve got a recipe for feeling awful we can start feeling so low as to want to check out with things like food and tv as you described it can take time for us to move to selfforgiveness and selfkindness in order to start moving forward again i wonder what you can do right now to improve your situation i also wonder if you may be willing to seek counseling to help you work through some of this to help with your perspective and to assist in your grieving process just reading these 3 sentences i get the sense of you being a nice person i hope you can show that kind of kindness to yourself in your healing
my grandma had a stroke and passed away recently i lost my home and job im looking but havent found a job ive been binge watching television and binge eating,please practice being kind to yourself you lost your grandmother your home and your job  huge changes have just taken place and it would be challenging for anyone to be unfazed  and having said that you wrote that you have been looking for a job so that tells me that you have most definitely not failed yourself try taking it one day at a time i encourage you to recognize and even accept that youre going through a particularly difficult time and that everything is temporary  when we are in something its difficult sometimes to see the light at the end of the tunnel  maybe you could allow yourself the grief that you are feeling be in the tunnel and trust that you will come through the tunnel to the other side  be gentle and loving to yourself
i feel like i hate myself physically and emotionally sometimes how can i start accepting myself and be more confident,youve already taken the first step you want to not hate yourself selfacceptance is hard and its on a spectrum on one side we have selfhate on the other extreme selflove and then there is all this stuff in the middle it kind of looks like thisand working toward selflove often means moving around through all these becoming aware of your emotions exploring the parts of you you that easier and harder to accept selfkindness selfforgiveness selfcompassion and ultimately selflove it is a recovery process and has to be an active thing each day meeting with a counselor can give you a partner in that process your counselor can also help you to recognize pieces that may be more difficult to see from your eyes as they have an outside view and with selfacceptance confidence comes naturally although you may need to practice behaviors that show assertiveness confidence and boundaries that protect you wishing you the absolute best with this
i feel like i hate myself physically and emotionally sometimes how can i start accepting myself and be more confident,selfdoubt and selfhatred are such common and unpleasant experiences and really worth  understanding therapy with the right person can really help when in your life do you feel the most confident what gets in the way of you accepting and loving yourself big question you can and will uncover that confident self
i feel like i hate myself physically and emotionally sometimes how can i start accepting myself and be more confident,self love and self acceptance is something that many of my clients struggle with so i can assure you that you are not alone we are bombarded by media and advertisements everyday that try to sell us things to make us somehow better thus leading us to believe that we are not enough unfortunately i believe that low self esteem is a social epidemicon a more personal level do you have any sense of what types of messages you have received in your life that have led to these self defeating thoughts for example did a parent or another loved one criticize you or put you down often were you bulled in school has a romantic partner emotionally abused you usually there are factors such as these which insidiously lead to low self esteem and self loathing once you can identify some of the factors that lead to your self hatred you can make a decision to not let these things from your past have such power over you any more you learn to take control of how you feel about yourself rather than letting others dictate that for you i do think it is possible to heal from self hatred it doesnt happen over night and it takes time and effort it is about retraining your brain to focus on your strengths rather than on your weaknesses none of us are ever going to be perfect and if we look for a flaw we are bound to find one or two or three try keeping a self esteem journal every night write down three things that you were proud of that day about yourself try reciting positive affirmations every day such as i am lovable and beautiful just the way that i am today to reprogram your mind into thinking highly of yourself rather than poorly
i feel like i hate myself physically and emotionally sometimes how can i start accepting myself and be more confident,the most important word here is sometimes i know it is quite painful and i can imagine that at times this pain doesnt feel like it will subside but it sounds like it is not all the time which means we can easily say that this hate myself experience is one part of you there are many other parts if you give them some space to also speak up that will offer you more positive regard trust me on that generally speaking we just dont know how to listen to those parts becauseit is the i hate myself part that is our inner critic and often our inner critic has developed a lot of strength throughout our life because of how weve depended on it for certain things sounds crazy but in actuality some of the most successful people in work mainly are those that have strong inner critics they use these critics to motivate themselves but with people and in relationships and in our relationship with ourselves it completely backfires because relationships are far more dynamic processes than doing well at workso try to acknowledge that the inner critic is one part of you that youve learned to give a lot of space to but if you sit with even a remotely positive feeling you have it can also be given the space to speak up and grow just like the critic has over time
i feel like i hate myself physically and emotionally sometimes how can i start accepting myself and be more confident,the answer would require a more indepth knowledge of you and your situation a lot of times these feelings are the result of the people in your life treating you a certain way you internalize it and accept it as your reality the first step is to evaluate the people close to you especially your parents even if you are an adult think back to your childhood children who grow up in an unstable home often grow up to be adults with insecurities and emotional problems the obvious such as being abused can certainly lead to a person having little to no confidence and self esteem but there are other situations that might surprise you to hear they can be damaging to a personyou may have never been physically or sexually abused but what about emotionally were you yelled at berated put down were you told youd never amount to anything were you compared to siblings and felt like you always fell short couldnt live up to expectations when you hear something over and over again you start to believe itmaybe you werent yelled at maybe it was the opposite studies show that children who grow up with a parent who is depressed show signs of emotional neglect a chronically depressed mother for example may have seemed cold detached emotionless she may have been less likely to show interest in a childs life not give praise for accomplishments or show support by going to ballgames or performances if one of your family members were chronically ill while you were growing up chances are a lot of the attention went to them which could have led to your needs not being metany of these situations could cause a person to grow up feeling unimportant unheard unloved or like they dont mattermaybe nothing ive described here fits your situation if you cant pinpoint what has caused you to feel this way on your own a counselor can helpi am not saying blame it on your parents or telling you theres nothing you can do to change it quite the opposite understanding why you feel that way is a first step towards making the changes needed to feel better cognitive behavior therapy focuses on cognition  figure out the why then behavior  the how
i feel like i hate myself physically and emotionally sometimes how can i start accepting myself and be more confident,this happens slowly and can be doneyou already are at the first step of realizing that you hate yourself not that the feelings of selfloathing are the best of what youre able to expect from lifea way to start building confidence is to pay close attention to the way you handle interactions and make decisionsif you start to notice what youd like from an interaction and afterwards reflect on how well you handled yourself especially with any unexpected circumstances youll build confidence in your ability to be good at somethingdo you know why you hate yourselfthis answer may help you address within yourself  a new type self talk which has more positives in it than what youve been accustomed to telling yourself
ive always thought that there wasnt much good out there for me now that things are actually going well it kind of scares me i spent most of my life feeling unwanted and figured i would be alone i recently met a great woman who seems to really like me and i dont know how to process this its bothering both of us,congrats on having a happiness problemgo slowly and tell your partner how you feel as you discover how being loved feelson a deep level youre releasing yourself from interaction patterns which treated you poorly and unkindlytime is needed of repeated occurrences of this newfound loving behavior toward yougradually you will trust more and more that your new living relationship life is your reality
ive always thought that there wasnt much good out there for me now that things are actually going well it kind of scares me i spent most of my life feeling unwanted and figured i would be alone i recently met a great woman who seems to really like me and i dont know how to process this its bothering both of us,youre in a lot of good company and its great that youre in a positive relationship congratulationsi often hear people talk about loving yourself and self esteem we often seem to blame ourselves for not loving ourselves enough or put ourselves down for having low self esteem it seems to me that since we are essentially socially beings and in fact need each other for our survival we really know who we are through our many interactions with others and with our environment in other words you cant just snap your fingers and voila now i love myself where there was an empty space or selfdoubt before we grow that warm coal inside ourselves through the friction of contact with others who value and validate us  allow yourself to be patient with yourself as you experience this new relationship you are learning a new model of who you are and how you fit into the world what a marvelous gift for you you may also have fears that the current joys may be temporary or unreliable these fears of loss may get in your way however understandable if you are truly close to your companion you can share with her that you are loving your relationship but sometimes fear it will go away and sometimes have trouble really trusting it such a conversation may bring you both closer hang in there youre working on cocreating a new normal with a great woman
ive always thought that there wasnt much good out there for me now that things are actually going well it kind of scares me i spent most of my life feeling unwanted and figured i would be alone i recently met a great woman who seems to really like me and i dont know how to process this its bothering both of us,hi thank you for your question its tough to be in a healthy and loving relationship when we believe we are not worth it quite often being in such a relationship is very uncomfortable as it goes against everything we believe about ourselves first i want to say you are very brave to open up yourself to the relationship with this wonderful woman you met second i would like to invite you to treat yourself with compassion as you are entering this unknown territory for yourself doing something new and totally unfamiliar can be scary so its vital that you are kind and gentle with yourself acknowledge that what you are doing is scary and uncomfortable and that it will take some time to get used to it dont judge yourself and force yourself to feel a certain way its important that you are patient with yourself and tolerant of your discomfort with time space kindness and tolerance your discomfort and fear will start to dissolve invite your new partner to also relate to your feelings in the open and compassionate way the worst thing that you or your partner can do is to rush your feelings pressure you to feel in a different way or to say that there is something wrong with you cause you feel a certain way please be gentle with yourself and celebrate and acknowledge every small victory every time you do something little like holding hands or receive a compliment and it no longer scares you as it did a week ago  celebrate that progress
ive always thought that there wasnt much good out there for me now that things are actually going well it kind of scares me i spent most of my life feeling unwanted and figured i would be alone i recently met a great woman who seems to really like me and i dont know how to process this its bothering both of us,this can be really anxietyproducing when you have not felt it before it may be helpful to work through some of this with a local therapist so you can get more specific ideassome other things that come to my mind are maybe talking about spending about 10 minutes or so discussing how you are feeling and seeing if your partner is willing to listen then you could ask questions about how she would react if you were doing something she did not like this allows you to react to information she is actually giving you rather than your perceptions that sound like they are different than what she is trying to tell you this gives you the power to receive the messages that she is sending to youi would also wonder where you have learned that there wasnt much good out there for you and how you can stay present in the moment when you are with your girlfriend and see that she wants to be there with you perhaps you could look at what makes you feel emotionally safe and trusting with her and focus on that you could even remind yourself okay im here with name of girlfriend and this is okay when im with herwe all have different levels of defenses in situations in which different people its common for people to see these things as black and white either totally open or very selfprotective in reality its much more like a rainbow and the different shades of color that are available in the rainbow spectrum of white light its not really just red orange yellow green blue indigo violet that we all know but an infinite spectrum of shades of colors that fade from one into the next you can change your level of defensiveness with your girlfriend depending upon the location you are in the mood you are both in the subject etc there are infinite numbers of choices and you can experimentanother thing that could help is to communicate about communication if one of you uses a phrase that triggers something from earlier in your life or is really uncomfortable you could discuss that if she says certain things that make you feel really comfortable you could discuss that as wellhopefully you can learn more about yourselves and each other at the same time
im a male in my 20s my girlfriend is in her late 30s shes great shes funny and smart she has a big heart and we have an excellent sex life she recently moved in with me partially because she wanted to and partially because she had no place to go we fight a lot its mostly my fault i must admit she doesnt like my insecurity and lack of trust i have for her i have trust issues also i cant fathom why a woman like her is with me so im always dreading when a better dude will come along i dont think shes happy shes very submissive and she loves me very much but also the fact that she has nowhere to go must be influencing her decision to stay i love her so much but my jealousy is not likely to diminish i never believed in the whole if you love them let them go but i do now i really want her to be happy should i end it with her she has no place to go so i feel like i cant break up with her im literally trapped,hi fort worth  i applaud your awareness and insight into the relationship  most of us come into relationships carrying old baggage and although you cant change her  what you can do is change yourself  we can usually begin to understand ourselves better in the context of our own upbringings  that is where we learn what a relationship looks like and it is often not the best teacher  i wonder about your jealously insecurity feeling trapped and a lack of trust  has that ever showed up anywhere before  it has more to do with you and less to do with her  your relationship with her is tapping into unresolved issues within yourself  that is really where you want to focus once you understand it and resolve it you will no longer need to ask anyone else what to do because you will know  you are young and just getting started in the relationship world and the healthier you are the better you will know what healthy looks like  know yourself understand yourself and love yourself  the rest will take care of itself  finding a therapist can be a big help in this process  you are asking the question so i suspect you are ready to look at the man in the mirror  i believe in you and am wishing you all the bestsandra cooper rn lpcmh

about 3 years ago or so i was skinny but i was still ugly i really do want to change that but ive tried 3 times now can i try but dont stop at school i get bullied about my weight and my ugliness and i have been bullied my whole life that i believe them how can i stop thinking about them and dont let it get in my head my parents said i dont weight that much but they do think i am fat but they tell me i am not i told my parents that i need to go to a therapist but they think i am fine and i think they dont want to deal with it,hey  i am so impressed with your efforts to ask questions to figure out how to change the messages that you hear and say to yourself and to get support  and it sounds like you want to make some changes in your life  take a walk over to the counseling office at school the school nurse or consider reaching out to your pediatricians office you dont have to have your parents permission to seek support for yourself  and maybe taking control of your support network will give you the strength to make even bigger decisions about your health  i am rooting for you  be wise

i feel as though im suffering severe abandonment issues stemming from childhood i convince myself im not worthy of happiness and im always afraid im doing something wrong its as if i create little scenarios in my mind and i start to believe them,i would like to offer my compassion that you are struggling with with these feelings with the information provided and not knowing what your childhood was like or what youve experienced i will say that from my experience working with people these feelings are normal and a normal part  of the process  of healing and just by posting your question tells me youre aware and desire to change this very good i commend your strength your feelings are not uncommon and the feelings of abandonment or second guessing or loss of happiness are also not uncommon  its also not uncommon for these issues to arise and trickle into our adult life and relationships again with little information about your situation it is hard to give an exact answer however those who have experienced a dysfunctional childhood or trauma often present with the issues and feelings youve described the great news is that with good therapy you can regain your happiness self worth and begin to feel  empowered you deserve to be happy be patient gentle and kind  to yourself i would encourage you to begin with searching for a licensed therapist in your area maybe go for a consultation session  and simply see how your feel about it therapy can be incredibly helpful and life changing i wish you the very best laura cassity lmsw lmac

im a teenage girl and i feel very bad about my weight i dont know how to make it stop,one way may be to take some sort of physical movement class in which you will be regarded by the teacher as one of the students not the girl who weighs a certain amountin a movement class such as pilates yoga aerobics weights dance when the standard for clothing is somewhat fitted and shows more of our physical bodies than regular clothing and to be considered as one of the students not stigmatized for how much or how little you weigh may help you be as accepting of yourself as the teacher is of you
im a teenage girl and i feel very bad about my weight i dont know how to make it stop,have you spoken to your health care provider about your weight  you may not have a medical issue  a lot of times we try to have the perfect body when in reality we try to live up to social standards  please set up a free consultation with me
what am i doing wrong my wife and i are fighting all the time what can i do we dont agree on anything and she usually jumps to conclusions which are usually wrong on how i feel she is very familyoriented while all of my family left me on my butt abused ignored and messed up with me mentally im not a familyoriented person i only have two people in my life  my best friend and my wife my mother forced my father out of my life so i do not know who he really is weve gotten in contact but he just makes comments on how much i look like her when in fact i look more like him this makes me mad because i dont want to look like my mother i hate her all that she did was bring me down and make me homeless which she was successful at i need guidance in my life i dont want to lose my wife but we need to have a space because we usually hit each other and its not healthy im dying to make our relationship healthy ive never wanted anything more than this please help me i need your advice,hello it sounds to me like you are carrying an enormous amount of emotional weight and maybe even an equally enormous amount of guilt and feelings of failure about your marriage i cannot imagine how challenging this is for you right now marriages take lots of work and often the only examples we tend to have are of those we saw when we were young  good bad or indifferent there are no easy answers to your questions and i wont presume that my response to you will be the linchpin that heals all your pain but i can maybe give some thoughts and reflections first and foremost cut yourself some slack no one is perfect we fail more often than we succeed but in the end we learn and that learning helps us grow yes youre right the abusive aspects of your marriage are not good and need to stop you probably are doing more harm than good in that regard and this will quickly destroy anything you have in your marriage that is even remotely in your favor seeing a therapist for yourself and then seeing a therapist as a couple is a good approach you have issues that you need to resolve that while they impact your marriage because they are part of the history of your life they are separate from your marriage in many respectsjoining a marriage support group can also be helpful you can find these through local counseling resources sometimes your local crisis numbers can provide services in your area that can be helpful if you belong to a religious or spiritual community then you might see if there is any type of counseling offered for free or at a reduced rate sometimes pastoral support is focused on the spiritual side of any issues addressed so if you feel this is important it might be a viable option for youlastly parents are imperfect yepits true they had no more of a guaranteed parenting success manual than you do at having chances for a perfect marriage we limp along and do our best having said that we can still take the best from our past and apply to our future no matter how small or insignificant it might be for us the bad stuff serves as lessons of what to avoid and we are each responsible and accountable for our actions in this life both with ourselves and toward other people so this becomes a guiding principle in our actions it may be that you discover that the marriage you are in is not a good fit  i am sure that remains to be seen but either way you both must be involved in saving it if only one of you cares then 100 of the energy to salvage the marriage rests on the shoulders of one person thats not fair so be sure you have a clear understanding from your wife about what she wants and work to create an amicable solution all of this said seek out supportive friends and actively work to do your part to make the changes you want to see in your life one way or the other you will benefit from itbe well
i am becoming a water safety instructor but i didnt have enough for a proper swimsuit i was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything i was very embarrassed,i also want to note that we as a society are especially judgemental about how women dress and present themselves  i am sorry that this boy said something insensitive  there is nothing shameful about your body and it was not your intention to display everything  it also wasnt his place to judge you as women we are expected to be sexy in some situations and demure in others  men dont have the same range of societal expectations to navigate  you didnt deserve his rudeness
i am becoming a water safety instructor but i didnt have enough for a proper swimsuit i was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything i was very embarrassed,first i think we have to acknowledge that you are doing something amazing you are putting yourself out there and becoming a water safety instructor  we often times will focus on the negative and forget about the positive next you had an incident where someone pointed something out which may have caused embarrassment whether or not it was malicious on his part i think the important thing to focus on is what is called common humanity common humanity is one of the three elements of selfcompassion common humanity essentially recognizes that suffering and personal inadequacy is part of the shared human experience while you may have had this embarrassing moment at this time that boy may have had an embarrassing moment another day we all have embarrassing moments when we recognize that we do not suffer in isolation then we are able to move past that suffering additionally another element to selfcompassion is selfkindness my question is why must you forgive yourself rather be kind to yourself for learning an amazing new talent
i am becoming a water safety instructor but i didnt have enough for a proper swimsuit i was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything i was very embarrassed,as far as i can tell you received unwanted attention but you didnt do anything wrong  what did your instructor say anything if the outfit was not appropriate then the instructor should tell youif heshe didnt then assume the swimsuit was okay but the gentleman in the class wanted your attention and took it upon himself to comment in order to get that attention  if you dont want his attention then you have a couple of choiceswear a shirt  over the swim top find an inexpensive swim top to replace the one you have or wear what you have as long as the instructor doesnt say anything and if you get unwanted attention say in as confident slightly loud voice as you can muster  i dont appreciate your critique of what im wearing were here to take a class lets just focus on that then  turn on your heel and walk away
i am becoming a water safety instructor but i didnt have enough for a proper swimsuit i was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything i was very embarrassed,everybody does something or a few things in their life which looking back the person wishes they hadntthe key to feeling better is to realize that as long as you learn something for the future from your mistake then you will be doing all that any human being is capable of doingyour mistake sounds genuine not that you were deliberately trying to create a stir or harm yourself or anyonenow that this student in your class pointed out your mistake you will learn to notice the appearance of your swimwearput in context that feeling foolish for doing something embarrassing means that overall you generally do most activity in your life in nonfoolish waysthe incident would only bother someone who generally is responsible  the mistake is a contrast with what is usual behavior for youi hope youll enjoy swimsuit shopping and find a beautiful bargain
i am becoming a water safety instructor but i didnt have enough for a proper swimsuit i was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything i was very embarrassed,sometimes we make ourselves feel worse with our own thoughts about things we cant change we know that it is possible to overcome embarrassment and selfblame but why does it seem so difficult to overcome it sometimes if you tune into your own thoughts or your internal dialogue youll notice that your thoughts are connected to your feelings so people who are holding onto embarrassment and selfblame often have thoughts like how could i do that i looked so stupid now people saw things i did not want them to see if we tune in more we might notice we are thinking that this is terrible horrible and that we cannot deal with it these are selfsabotaging thoughts that lead to shame selfblame and embarrassment if you look at the evidence you can find more rational thoughts such as  we all make mistakes people can look all different ways at different time  this incident does not define me and if someone has a bad image or thought about me it is really ok people have all kinds of thoughts about other people and it does not have to be a major problem when you practice your rational thoughts often and replace the negative ones you will start to feel better more confident and your embarrassment will decrease quickly
i am becoming a water safety instructor but i didnt have enough for a proper swimsuit i was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything i was very embarrassed,first of all congratulations to you on becoming a water safety instructoras far as how to forgive yourself this is probably one of the toughest things that we ask of ourselves no matter the subject on the other hand it sounds like the location of the mistake means that after you get through the class you wont see the same people much longer so hopefully the embarrassment will be temporaryas far as the class maybe you can give yourself compassion for the idea that we all make mistakes and it certainly sounds like it wasnt intentional i think we have all had a swimsuit shift in unwanted directiontrying to make sure that the same thing doesnt happen again would probably be helpful but it sounds like you are already doing that something else you could do is think of something you can say to yourself when someone says something embarrassing about that occurrence such as it was an accident and i have fixed it nowyou may find some helpful tips here httptinybuddhacomblogletgopastmistakes6stepsforgiving or here httppsychcentralcomlibhowdoyouforgiveyourself  these are not meant to be resources related to religion but it is mentioned in a few places
on the first day of school i wore a bra that was too big so that it would look like i had bigger boobs i did that the whole school year and my parents never found out but now i can never hang out with my friends at my house or invite them over because it would be around my parents and my friends would see there is nothing there on my chest how do i fix this,i get how you feel you wish your body looked different and youre embarrassed that you tried to make it look different and people may notice you dont say how old you are its likely that if you are young your body will change as you mature but in general were given the bodies were given and im glad to see that there may be a desire in you to accept your body the way it is you seem to want to stop disguising it bodies come in all shapes and sizes and every woman knows how it feels to struggle with accepting what hers looks like many men go through this as well although women are more often targeted with cultural messages about how were supposed to look young people often believe that others are noticing and judging them in fact other people are far more preoccupied with who might be judging them than whatevers going on with you i suggest you wear whatever bra you want to wear and if someone is rude enough to comment on it you can ignore them and talk about the weather or the latest pop song that you love and theyll get the hint but my bet is they wont even notice 
on the first day of school i wore a bra that was too big so that it would look like i had bigger boobs i did that the whole school year and my parents never found out but now i can never hang out with my friends at my house or invite them over because it would be around my parents and my friends would see there is nothing there on my chest how do i fix this,sometimes we let our insecurities get the best of us causing us to make some interesting choices honesty is always the best policy but honesty comes with risk  perhaps you may want to start with your family first explaining to them what you have done and why  perhaps they can help you to practice talking about your insecurities with your friends another way is to start slowly to dress more and more like yourself and your true body shape some of your friends may make fun of you true but then you must ask yourselfwhy do you want to be friends with people like that

i feel like every time i do something someone asks me to i never fully meet what they want i feel that when i finish it they always think that they should have picked someone else to do it i feel like they just want nothing to do with me,it sounds like you have the perception that people are frequently disappointed in you wish you were different or someone else and ultimately reject you one question i would have for you is what is your evidence that people feel this way is there anything in peoples words or behaviors that gives you this impression if your not sure it may be useful for you to try to notice what people say and do in response to you even though you perceive these attitudes within them additionally working with a competent therapist may be a great way to get an answer to your question as well as developing ways to move forward with that answer and gain a sense of selfesteem and security in your relationshipsone possibility that comes to mind of which there may be more is that as we grow up we often develop relational templates or sets of expectations about how people are and will relate to us which influence our experiences and behavior in relationships sometimes the templates that we develop to stay connected growing up are not particularly adaptive for adult life and can hamper our selfesteem and capacity for comfortable intimacy as an adult you ask a great question here and one that can be very hard to see through given the difficulty of feeling that people think of you in this way and i hope that you will stay curious about this and consider working with a therapist who is trained to help you discover the answer
i feel like every time i do something someone asks me to i never fully meet what they want i feel that when i finish it they always think that they should have picked someone else to do it i feel like they just want nothing to do with me,as long as you try to reach others expectations you will never feel satisfied or accepted how about setting your own expectations for self and strive for those make sure your expectations are reachable and realistic

whether its to a guy or girl i always feel insecure talking and i am afraid of embarrassing myself and not being good enough even when i am walking i worry about my appearance and facial expression and such,hi im glad you wrote because i think a lot of people have this same issue to different degrees and we dont talk about it much you have some social anxiety that is a bit beyond what the average person might feel most people have some amount of worry about what others might think of them and this probably prevents us from making complete fools of ourselves so thats a good thing but your alarm system is out of whack and you are spending too much time worrying about how you come across as you age you understand this more and its truethat other people really arent thinking about you much or monitoring you at all theyre too busy having the same thoughts youre having am i good enough do people like me judge methink im weird were all concerned about how we come across far more than how others come across like many people you lack compassion for yourself acceptance of yourself and confidence in yourself my gut says that these things came from somewhere in your past our sensitivities usually come from as well as genetics a specific time in our life when we experienced or felt something that was overwhelming and we end up with an alarm system that overreacts at times without more details its difficult to go further here i recommend you see a therapist who does cognitive behavioural therapy which can help you understand the roots of your fears and learn how to manage them more successfully
whether its to a guy or girl i always feel insecure talking and i am afraid of embarrassing myself and not being good enough even when i am walking i worry about my appearance and facial expression and such,i want to add that one way therapy can help with social anxiety is to give you a corrective experience  each week you sit across from someone who genuinely cares about you who doesnt judge you and who you can voice your concerns to  over time you show them more and more of yourself and as they get to know you they still care about you they still dont judge you and they still think you are amazing  find a therapist you connect with
my roommate has had a drinking problem for a while she goes out gets trashed and then expects everyone to take care of her the next morning she apologizes constantly until she feels validated she also thinks everyone hates her all the time if i dont seem anything other than happy she asks me do you hate me you hate me tell me you love me and i feel like i have to pity her because she has also been suicidal before,it does sound like your roommate may have a drinking problem and the short answer is that you cant do anything about it only she can we cant change what other people say think or do we can only change our reactions it does sound like your roommate may be having a hard time you can suggest that she enter counseling or therapy you can reassure her that you like her if thats true but you dont have to pity her
i always feel the need to impress people whether its my family the people at school or just random people i know that no matter what i do or how i change there will always be some people who hate me why do i feel this way,my first reaction to this is that it sounds like you rely alot on the impressions and projections of the outside world that you need validation from other people to compensate for a lack of something on the inside build yourself up on the inside work on yourself use positive affirmations daily it would be wise for you to research some selfconstruct theory and do some selfconcept workhope this helpsc
i always feel the need to impress people whether its my family the people at school or just random people i know that no matter what i do or how i change there will always be some people who hate me why do i feel this way,it is normal to seek others attention and noticing that some people would not be interested  after all we belong to a social environment where we constantly receive others feedback which at times validates us makes feel important and useful like we belong but also at times makes us feel isolated different and neglected which we could interpret as hatethe key is to be aware of what you think about what people think of you  got it this part can be tricky at times because what others think about us does not really affect us what really affects us is what we decide to believe internalize and make our reality for example i could choose to ignore a persons comment about me or i could decide to focus on it all day analyze why they said that and what have i done to them to get to that conclusion  eventually since we became so focused on that thought we may end up believing that what the other person said about us was true even if we did not agree to begin withso how can we fix this awareness is the key it is important that you understand the way you internalize external inputs like comments and to go through a process of discarding negative ones it is also helpful to talk to your counselor about how you process feedback and validation so you learn to balance your positive traits from negatives and how that affects your relationships and selfesteemcã³mo me puede importar menos lo que la gente piensasiempre siento la necesidad de impresionar a otros ya sea mi familia la gente de la escuela o extraãos  y sã que no importa lo que haga o cuanto haga siempre habrã personas que me odian por quã me siento asães comãºn que busquemos la atenciã³n de otros y notemos que algunas personas no estãn interesadas despuãs de todo pertenecemos a un ambiente social donde constantemente recibimos comentarios que a veces nos validan alagan y nos hacen sentir como parte importante y funcional de la sociedad pero en otros momentos nos hacen sentir aislados ignorados y diferentes lo cual lo pudiãramos interpretar como odiola clave es estar conscientes de lo que pensamos que los otros piensan de nosotros me sigues esta parte puede ser algo confusa porque lo que piensan otras personas de nosotros no nos afecta directamente lo que si nos afecta es lo que decidimos creer que otras personas piensan de nosotros y luego lo internalizamos y hacemos parte de nuestra vida por ejemplo podemos decidir ignorar lo que una persona dice de nosotros o podemos decidir enfocarnos en ello todo el dãa analizando en detalle porque lo dijeron y que hemos hecho para hacer que ellos piensen asã eventualmente nos enfocamos tanto en ese pensamiento que terminamos creyendo que es verdad aun cuando originalmente no lo creãamos asãentonces como lo arreglamos la clave es concientizaciã³n es importante entender la manera en que internalizamos las opiniones de otros y que pasemos por un proceso de discriminaciã³n donde descartemos los comentarios negativos hasta que aprendamos a ignorarlos tambiãn ayudarãa hablar con un consejero sobre como internamente validas y descartas los comentarios y opiniones externas y como eso puede estar afectando tus relaciones y tu autoestima

something happened this summer that i cannot forgive myself for when i think about what happened i feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me,hello and thank you for your question guilt is one of those things that nearly everyone has experienced at one time or another and it can feel like a huge weight around your neck unfortunately it is unlikely that we can give you some words of wisdom that will make it all go away however i will give you some ideas and hopefully this will helpone of the things that we know about guilt is that it doesnt usually do much to help us in the longrun people may make changes for a shortterm period of time because they feel guilty about something they did but usually they will go back to their old behaviors if they dont have something else to help them change permanently such as a new skill so guilt doesnt necessarily help us in fact as i write this someone out there is eating an entire key lime pie because they feel guilty about falling off their diet someone may be drinking alcohol because they feel guilty about drinking alcohol for whatever reason this is just a common thing that we do now accountability is different than guilt accountability can actually be constructive when you hold yourself accountable you can admit that you have done something wrong that it hurt others and you deeply regret it that you are prepared to take steps to make sure it doesnt happen again that you have done what you can to make amends if necessary that you are sorry and then you move on why is moving on necessary well for one thing it doesnt usually help the people who you hurt in fact someones guilty behavior may serve to remind the people who were hurt over and over again about what happened guilt is usually 100 about us and not about those we hurt also guilt can lead us to behave in ways that may even hurt people more having said all of that guilt is a normal human emotion sometimes we experience it for a while and it goes away sometimes we need help to work through it there are many selfhelp books about forgiving yourself you can try amazon to find some or consider getting help from a counselor be wellrobin landwehr dbh lpc ncc
something happened this summer that i cannot forgive myself for when i think about what happened i feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me,a lot of times it is not about forgiveness but learning from experiences as an example as a child we continously fall in an effort to learn how to walk then when we begin walking we know we have to put one foot in front of the other in order to move forward experiences allow us to grow find a balance and what to do and what not to do in order to move forward on the positive side you now know the consequences as for your actions not to take the same course forgiveness comes with time as you learn how to walk again
something happened this summer that i cannot forgive myself for when i think about what happened i feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me,realize that you are human not perfect and will make the wrong decisions at times  that is ok we all have however the best way is to say ok i did it learned from it will not do that again ever you can get pass it grow from it unfortunately we forgive others faster than we do ourselves because we hold ourselves to higher standards or expected better behavior from ourselves it can be embarrassing hurtful almost unforgiving at times but how do you forgive yourself take a deep breathe and then acknowledge that you did something wrong acknowledge it and say to self i forgive me just like you would say to someone else  this starts the process of forgiving also ask yourself these questions  what lesson did i learn what would i have done differently what will be a trigger that will make me do that again if i happened to be weak or tempted avoid or prepare for those triggers  forgiving yourself will set you free from the prison you have put yourself in you would start back living
something happened this summer that i cannot forgive myself for when i think about what happened i feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me,what a beautiful discussion of guilt and shame lynda offers those two demons start out as pesky and little when we are young then grow with us to become quite formidable id like to throw in a technique i learned from randy rausch author of the last lecture called the 3step apology i teach this important bit of wisdom to my clients when they need to apologize to someone else but more importantly when they need to forgive themselvesyes when we have trouble forgiving ourselves we sometimes forget that there is part of us that just doesnt know how to apologize effectively here goesstep one say what you did and the damage it causedstep two say youre sorry and accept full responsibility no excuses no explanation no defensiveness œit was all my faultstep three ask what you can do to repair the damagestep three is the one many of us didnt learn growing up and when we add it to an apology we are usually surprised that the penalty is as light as it is of course sometimes the apology is not accepted and no way to atone is offered so be it we cant control this but if we are apologizing to ourselves we can there is always a way to make amends if we put our heart into it give this a try the next time youre reluctant to let yourself off the hook you might surprise yourself when how benevolent you can be when invited
something happened this summer that i cannot forgive myself for when i think about what happened i feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me,hi ohio i totally get how it can be more difficult to forgive ourselves than to forgive others my guess is that you tend to come down too hard on yourself a lot thats a huge barrier to happiness that you can work to reduce ill get you startedyou feel shame in a debilitating way that is probably way out of proportion to the incident is it triggering some old shame unfortunately a lot of adults use shame as a motivator for kids it doesnt work when was the first time you remember feeling a lot of shame as in im bad or im worthless is there a younger version of you who is still feeling shame over something that wasnt your fault sometimes shame shadows are connected to an absent or hurtful parent sexual abuse or some family loss or trauma if so picture yourself at that age can you tell your child self that whatever horrible thing happened to them isnt their fault can you have compassion for that child who first felt shame or had shame heaped on them thats your first goalto go to the source of the shame and heal that childs wound with compassion what happens to children is never their fault and fault is a pretty useless concept anywayonce you take the layers of old im bad shame off the load is lighter and you can use self talk to further reduce the shame here are some things you can say to yourselfevery dayim human and thats okay i dont have to be perfecti can have compassion for my mistakesi can feel proud that im facing my mistake and making things righti deserve forgiveness and compassion and i have that for other people tootheres no purpose to holding on to shamei can learn from my mistakes and move forwardeveryone makes mistakesother people dont want me to carry this shame aroundi dont need shame to remind me not to do it again ive figured that outshame tries to convince you that you need to carry it around in order to prevent further mistakes poppycock  youve learned your lesson now you can move forward to other mistakes sorrybut youre human and youll keeping making hopefully different glorious mistakes embrace the learning lean into the experiences of life its all juicy stuff and youre in good company were all in the same position of being mortal
i constantly feel like everyone is up against me and trying their best to shut me down its ruining my mood and even my whole self i have trouble sleeping and i keep having sleep paralysis while dreaming of others mocking and judging me,the problem you describe sounds very wearing on your spiritare there particular reasons for why you feel everyone hates youhave you been in a clash of ideas or opinions and feel yourself in the minority viewpointor does your sense of being shut out start within your own mind as though you anticipate that others will not like what you sayif actual conversations are leading you to feel left out then evaluate whether to bring up certain points to the other personor you may also decide that the relationships in which you feel shut out are no longer worthwhile ones for youif the problem is hesitating to interact because you imagine others will reject you then maybe you can coach yourself into trying a small step toward introducing yourself and your thoughts to others

i feel like im trying to convince myself that im okay when im not im always blocking out the bad things and forgetting i also feel like nobody cares for me and they never will i feel truly alone,im glad youre aware of how you honestly feel  knowing ones personal truth is always the first step in finding what is necessary to be and developreflect a little more on the type of care youd like in your lifecare means anything from checking in on someone to deep intimate connection between two peopleknowing your own definition of care is the first step to know what is necessary for you to recognize what youd like attractingit is much easier to attract what wed like if we are clear on what this is
i feel like im trying to convince myself that im okay when im not im always blocking out the bad things and forgetting i also feel like nobody cares for me and they never will i feel truly alone,as social creatures we humans all long for deep human connection to know that we belong and are part of something larger it is so important to us that when we feel alone  it can feel almost unbearable you are not alone in feeling alone while it can take time to build deep relationships there are moments in each day where we have the opportunity to interact with other people who may also feel lonely and scared and want to be seen and acknowledged i wonder what it might be like for you if you took on an experiment of trying to really see the people around you and make little attempts to acknowledge and connect with them  fellow humans on this journey of life a good morning at the bus stop or really looking at the person who you buy your groceries from or thanking or complimenting someone for something that you notice and appreciate while this is not a substitute for close relationships these moments of real connection with the people who we share our communities with can go a long way to realizing that we are not as alone as we may have thought
i feel so irritated and frustrated because of it i get so angry to the point that i feel like im going to explode i feel pathetic stupid and worthless i just cant take this anymore,yeah i get the same problem look im not a professional but ive heard a few things a powernap can help just a half hour of sleep can clear your mind and let you refocus also brain activity increases with physical exertion just walk around for a minute and get your brain working and thatll help you reach the task at hand taking breaks it totally okay try to have something to do in between that you enjoy
ive been with the mother of my child for years,i would think that you hold little self worth and feel that you are not worthy of better  i would suggest that you get to know yourself  what do you need in a relationship  what is holding you to this relationship other than your child  what have gone on in the relationship that makes you think or feel you deserve such disrespect  just a few questions to ask yourself
i have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for about six years now in the past our relationship was difficult and frustrating we argued a lot and due to that there was a lot of tension between us we stayed together because we love each other and wanted to make it work i used to party a lot and several times i got into situations where i would end up kissing someone else these situations were never more than just kissing i have come clean about these situations with my boyfriend and he decided to forgive and move forward with me i love him so much and want to work things out too but im having a difficult time understanding how he can forgive me i cant seem to forgive myself im overwhelmed with feelings of guilt and unworthiness,hi cerritosthis is an interesting twist because its more common for the person in your position to want to move forward and for the person who was wronged to struggle with forgiveness you are lucky to have a loving compassionate partner and your boyfriend is lucky to have a partner who takes full responsibility for their actions my hunch is that you learned some things about yourself when you were younger that are playing a role here your sense of worthlessness seems out of proportion to the mistakes you made you dont have to be perfect in order to deserve the love of a good man you only have to have the maturity to recognise when youve hurt someone and work hard to make it better who in your life overreacted to small mistakes you made were you shamed as a child did you learn that you deserved to be punished did something bad happen that you thought was your fault is there a mistake you made long ago that you need forgiveness for there is a younger person inside you waiting to be forgiven for something they werent entirely responsible for the bar is too high for you if i was your therapist i would work with you to find the source of the shame and address that wound if you want to move forward and be with your boyfriend your job will be to forgive yourself forgiving doesnt mean it was okay forgiving simply means that it happened that you cant erase it and that you dont want to carry it around or punish yourself for it anymore you have done many things here that you can feel proud of youve come clean youve been honest youve taken responsibility for your actions youve not tried to minimize what you did and youve chosen to be more loyal and aware of how you impact your boyfriend these are all things you can use to build your sense of worth you are acting very honourably its time to put your past mistakes away on the shelf knowing that youve learned from them and are a better person now its not our mistakesnot our worst moments that define usits how we handle them afterwardsi wish you growth and happiness

when im not cutting im drinking when i try healthy outlets such as exercise i end up running myself down into an asthma attack from weapons to words i cant help but self harm what am i supposed to do how do i stop this cycle i dont know how else to cope or motivate myself without pain,it sounds like you are feeling helpless and out of control you are concerned about your behavior and at the same time you feel compelled to continue it in working with a therapist you may be able to get insight into what is motivating these behaviors develop strategies for taking care of yourself and get a stronger sense of who you are motivated to be when you are your authentic self
im in my late 20s and ive never had a boyfriend or even been on a date i have no friends i hate facebook because everyone else has kids and a great husband and great paying jobs i work in retail and i cant find a job i have an associate degree no one is not giving me a chance and im getting upset and frustrated i feel worthless and feel like everyone hates me i feel like a failure and i still live with my dad its very embarrassing,in case knowing this helps you there are many more people in similar circumstance as you than you may realizesimilar to you they are not on fb for the reasons you list  plus no one wants to go on fb and tell the world they dont have a fantastic life  everyone on fb is happy even when theyre miserable theyre happy telling everyone about itfirst yes it is painful to see all around you what appears as joyful living  please keep in mind that the life you imagine these people have is not necessarily the true life they are having  ive been a therapist for a long time and have seen repeatedly how people who are married with kids by age 30 start having problems by their midthirtiessecond respect your unique identity  for whatever reason you have more sensitivity possibly more depth more complex standards and expectations of yourself and othersas hard as it may sound or actually be take time to hear your intuition and what it tells you you need for your own growth and developmentfeeling embarrassed can also be turned into a positive  consider it as motivation for the long term to develop new ways of reaching your goalsi hope this helps
its been almost a year since my exboyfriend broke up with me after he cheated on me many times i had found out about a month before but i hadnt told him i knew because i didnt want us to break up i used to have very low selfesteem and i think it might have to do with my dad being an alcoholic my father cheated on my mother when i was little i wonder if this pain has to do with that my exboyfriend and i were only dating for five months but i still cant get over this betrayal im not sure what to feel to get over it forgiveness hate he helped me financially after our break up by lending me 3000 so im grateful for that i still hate him for what he did and still want him to like me although were not even talking anymore we follow each other on instagram and thats it i feel like i still need his validation this is haunting me day and night i want to focus on my new relationship and goals but i keep obsessing over this and keep checking my exboyfriends instagram and facebook i feel so bad and keep having nightmares,the dilemmas you present are giving you a great chance to understand your true reasons for being in a relationshipcontinue developing some points youve written herethat you grew up sensing andor witnessing your moms emotional pain from your dad cheating on her very likely set a standard in your inner self to expect similar circumstances in your relationship lifethis is a natural dynamic which happens for all of us  what we observe in our growing up households is what we understand as normal no matter how bad it actually isafter all children dont have the ability to separate that what their own parents do is wrong compared with the rest of our cultureit is natural to long for a relationshipwhat you have the chance to do now is distinguish the reasons for your longingis it to attach to someone who has hurt you hasnt shown you any understanding of having hurt you and whose validation even if he says validating words has little meaning because people who validate are not the ones who harm usif youre able to teach yourself that those who love us do not harm us and to develop new expectations for yourself of feeling good from how your partner treats you then you will be showing yourself a road that will benefit you for your entire lifetime
im in my early 20s ive been married once and he cheated on me ever since then ive felt ugly no matter what im engaged and i still feel ugly i dont like to take pictures of myself,sounds as though youre taking the blame for the bad actions of your former husbandhe did an ugly action and instead of feeling only your own emotions in response to being cheated on you are holding his ugly behavior within you and feeling itdoes this sound like a possible explanation of why your feeling of ugliness started after the cheating incidentyou may start feeling better by looking within your own heart for the full effects of having been hurt  it is possible there is more suffering within you than youve realized until nowas you address all the emotional pain youve lived through the feeling of ugliness may drop out all of its own because youd be focused on you not on any of the ugliness introduced into your life by your cheating ex husband
im scared that i am with this man so i wont be alone he should be with somebody who deserves him if this is the case and i dont want to hurt him,while not wanting to be alone may not be the best reason to be in a relationship it is probably more common and normal a reason than you think  since you seem to care about your friend dont want to hurt him i imagine there are many other reasons that you are together  i suggest that you talk about this openheartedly with each other  the idea of being afraid of being alone sounds like an honest starting place  dont try to figure out whether you should be with him  just talk  the communication is likely to shine light on deepening connection for both of youin the meantime your idea that you dont deserve him is rooted in a core lie that you are telling yourself  you can read about core lies and much more in my book living yes a handbook for being human  check out wwwlivingyesorgbe easy on yourself  you are deservingmark
i like getting attention from men i dont have sex i lead them on to thinking i might want to i like to tease i like for men to chase me and i like to feel wanted,hi michigan good for you for recognising a destructive pattern this behaviour although it might get you the attention you want initially will ultimately drive men away because its not respectful of them my gut says that you learned early on in life that your value is in your sexuality alone thats a powerful thought you are certainly acting as if this is true if you believed in your value as a person you would be less afraid of deeper relationships and intimacy in general if i were your therapist id have many questions for you and i would need to understand a lot of things about you and your past to help you sort out where this idea about yourself came from id suggest reaching out to a qualified therapist who can help you get to the root of this behaviour good luck
everyone around me is much smarter and flaunts it everyone around me is skinny and here i am trying to throw up so im not fat everything i do is wrong and i cant seem to do anything right no one else at school seems to feel the way i do is this normal teenage girls feelings i dont think these feelings are normal,there are some struggles that are less obvious than others an eating disorder being one of them from just your personal experience alone you might realize how easy it may seem to keep such a secret from those around you in the same way there are many people who struggle secretly with this problem and not many people know or even notice so you are definitely not alone low selfesteem or lack of confidence in some areas are issues that every teen in fact every person has experienced at some point these feelings are normal it sounds though as if these feelings of insecurity and inadequacy have begun to consume your every day thoughts and behaviors bringing you to where you are today  comparing yourself to others purging and feeling extreme guilt sometimes its best if we seek outside help instead of trying to tackle problems on our own breaking habits that come along with an eating disorder really requires the help of a doctor nutritionist and a therapist who can help change your perspective from the inside out hope this helps
i was raped by multiple men and now i cant stand the sight of myself i wear lingerie to get my self excited enough to have sex with my wife,hello utah thank you for writing with your question sexual assault or sexual abuse is a very traumatic event that affects victims in many ways your difficulty in feeling sexually engaged and your description of the shame and selfloathing you feel are normal responses to the rapes you experienced a good therapist can help you to process your traumas and understand that you did nothing wrong to cause the rapes the shame is not yours it takes a very patient and loving partner but you can make progress towards a healthier sexual relationship with your wife these are issues that i cannot address more fully here other than to recommend that you seek the assistance of a qualified professional
i was raped by multiple men and now i cant stand the sight of myself i wear lingerie to get my self excited enough to have sex with my wife,i am very sorry to hear about your rapes  traumatic events such as rape can have some lasting effects  issues with sex drive are one of these effects  therapy can help to decrease the impact that traumatic events have upon our lives as we process through some of our experiences  emdr can be a particularly effective modality of treatment to address this issues  i would also encourage you to have an honest conversation with your wife about this concern  sometimes it is helpful to have that conversation with a therapist so that the therapist can help educate  your wife in regards to effects of trauma  this may help her understand that your feelings are more about the trauma and less about her as a person  best of luck to you
